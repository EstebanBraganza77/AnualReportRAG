He was anxious to start a \\nbusiness beyond investing, which would \\nenable him to test his hypothesis about \\nthe Indian consumer. After a couple of \\nyears of introspection and research,  \\nhe decided to start a grocery retail chain, \\nfocusing primarily on the value segment. \\nDMart, our retail chain, was conceived \\nby him in the year 2000. Mr. Damani \\nimagined the retail business with the \\nsame values of simplicity, speed, and \\nnimbleness that he espoused in his \\nstellar investing career. \\nAbout DMart | Core Values, Vision and Mission\\nA focus on financial fundamentals, \\nhigh\\xa0levels of patience and strong \\nconviction have been the bedrock \\non which the Company’s values and \\nbusiness direction have been built. \\nDMart took eight years to start its first \\nten stores. This wasn’t because of dearth \\nof investment opportunities, but more \\nbecause of his belief in the importance \\nof validating the business model from \\na perspective of both profitability and \\nscalability. His beginnings at DMart \\nwere frugal. For a number of years since \\ninception, DMart’s corporate operations \\nwere run from a small space carved out \\nfrom one of the early stores. He and his \\nearly leadership team worked together \\nas one cohesive unit without any \\nhierarchy or barriers.  \\nDMart was conceived by value investor Mr. Radhakishan \\nDamani in the year 2000, who at the time was operating \\na single store in Maharashtra. With a mission to be the \\nlowest-priced retailer in its area of operation, DMart has \\ngrown steadily over the years, and operates 365 stores in \\n10 States, 1 Union Territory and NCR. The Company has \\ndelivered stable performance across stakeholder metrics \\nby focusing on financial fundamentals, with fortitude and \\nstrong conviction.\\nMore importantly, from the very \\nbeginning, he had the foresight to \\nunderstand and strongly believed that \\nany business needs the right blend of \\nentrepreneurship and professionalism. \\nEntrepreneurship to build and strengthen \\nthe concept in its formative years, and \\nprofessionalism to allow a committed \\nteam to create, sustain and grow a \\nscalable business model into the future. \\nToday, DMart continues to focus on this \\nearly belief system created during our \\nformative years. We have a good blend \\nof entrepreneurial spirit and high-quality \\nexecution. We humbly attribute our \\nsuccess to the values and the way of \\nbusiness thinking that our founder has \\ninstilled in us.'),\n",

It is our endeavour to \\nmake customers come to our store less \\noften but buy significantly more than \\nthey would buy at any other retail store. \\nThis approach helps us create capacity \\nto serve more customers per day. \\nA\\xa0customer buying a very large quantity \\nof goods once or twice a month is also \\nsignificantly better for the climate than \\n10 quick deliveries a week of small value \\nitems at the doorstep.\\nBoth types of need exist and hence \\nmultiple formats of retail evolve. \\nHowever, we like to play in the bulk \\nbuying need sector. This invariably \\nneeds a lot of hard work from our \\nemployees and partners, precision \\nsystems and a competent workforce. \\nHence our focus on recruiting locals in \\nevery location and then upskilling them \\nand grooming them to become leaders \\nof tomorrow is very intrinsic to our model \\nof efficient operation and long-term \\ncompetitive advantage. Our endeavour \\nis also to nurture local products and \\nlocal businesses so that they too can \\ncompete with minimal costs to launch \\ntheir products. At the same time, we \\nhave active conversations with our large \\nand organised suppliers on how they \\ncould create a positive impact to climate \\nchange through innovation. We have just \\nbegun this journey and we hope to make \\ngood progress over time.\\nOur purpose to deliver good products \\nalso means we make significant \\nattempts to enhance the quality of \\nproducts such that they have durability \\nand long-lasting capability while also \\ndelivering great value to the shopper. \\nOur view on quality is that it is relative \\nto the evolution of the customer in that \\nstate or city. It is our constant attempt to \\nnudge the customer to choose wisely, \\nsuch that in the long-term they get great \\nvalue by choosing good-quality products.\\nOur commitment to making \\nimprovements towards the environmental \\nsituation is reflected in increasingly \\ngetting our locations certified under \\nGreen Building movement in India - \\n217\\xa0buildings of the Company have \\nachieved Green Building Certifications \\n(GBC) (38 buildings with Gold \\ncertification under US GBC LEED, 1 \\nbuilding with Gold Certification under \\nIndian GBC LEED, and 178 buildings \\nwith Gold Certification under Indian \\nGBC). That apart, our footprint decisions \\nconsider optimal use of resources and \\nit is our earnest attempt to minimise \\nadverse environmental impact.\\nWe have integrated consolidation of \\nbuying and transporting merchandise \\nthrough our large distribution centers into \\nour model as opposed to being delivered \\nin small lots to our various stores by \\nvendors, increasing deployment of \\nvehicles using greener fuel; continually \\nincreasing use of solar energy; \\nfreshwater conservation practices viz. \\nuse of sewage treatment plants, waste-\\nwater recycling, rainwater harvesting, \\nUse of spray washers etc; responsible \\ndisposal of plastic waste and electronic \\nwaste; responsibly sourced papers (FSC \\ncertified papers & boards), choice of \\nsustainable building materials as few \\nmajor initiatives that help us conserve \\nkey resources. We also have a very large \\ninstallation of an IOT ecosystem that \\nmonitors many of our energy consuming \\nequipment and recommends basis \\nalerts on early warnings of possible \\nbreakdowns and energy conservation \\npossibilities.\\nOur first few steps on Sustainability \\nhave been to identify a few key ideas \\nand go ahead and implement them. \\nWe are now in the process of building \\nsystems to measure, monitor and then \\ndefine and design the direction on other \\naspects of sustainability. Our belief is \\nthat Sustainability has to be intrinsic to \\nour business model. Unless there is an \\neconomic model to Sustainability, it won’t \\nlast too long. The Sustainability Matrix \\nthat we have defined for ourselves is \\nthe culmination of that deliberation \\nand crystalisation of the direction we \\nwant to take to achieve our goals. In \\norder to achieve these targets, we have \\nestablished management systems \\nwhich entail regular monitoring of KPIs, \\ndevelopment of an environmental \\nmanagement plan and reviewing \\nprogress on a regular basis.\\nWe have a Sustainability Officer who \\nis responsible for periodic review of \\nmaterial issues, scanning the external \\nenvironment for evolving sustainability \\ntrends and regulations, monitoring the \\nprogress on sustainability targets and \\nfacilitating in implementing sustainability \\ninitiatives. It is our firm belief that a far \\nmore sustainable world for the future \\nwill be led by a congruence of efforts \\n– regulatory, economic, best-in-class \\npractices by our Company, our suppliers \\nand most importantly by our shoppers \\nthrough the choices they make while \\nshopping with us.\\n\\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW \\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n14\\nThe above matrix indicates some of our efforts within each dimension.

Offering free \\ncoaching levels the playing field, ensuring that students from all \\nsocio-economic backgrounds have an equal chance to pursue \\nhigher education and professional success. Education is also \\none of the most effective tools for breaking the cycle of poverty. \\nBy empowering students from low-income backgrounds with \\nthe skills and knowledge needed to succeed academically, they \\nare better equipped to secure high-paying jobs and improve \\ntheir socio-economic status. Many bright and talented students \\nfrom low-income families do not have access to the resources or \\nguidance to excel in competitive exams like JEE/NEET. Such a \\nprogramme allows the society to tap into this pool of meritorious \\nstudents.\\nDMart has been extending support to Dakshana India Education \\nTrust (henceforth, Dakshana) since 2021-22. Dakshana is a \\nphilanthropic foundation with a mission centred around the \\nidea that education is the most powerful and enduring weapon \\nto win the battle against poverty. Dakshana helps bright and \\nimpoverished students, predominantly from rural India, to prepare \\nfor engineering and medical entrance(competitive) exams. \\nDakshana has been offering free coaching scholarships to less \\nadvantaged students from government schools to prepare for \\ncompetitive exams such as JEE/ NEET/ AIIMS for over 17 years \\nwith great success. This project is in alignment with DMart vision \\nof supporting the education of underprivileged children. This \\ninitiative promotes social cohesion and inclusivity. An amount of \\n` 2.5 crore was disbursed for contribution towards scholarship \\nfor students’ coaching, access to educational resources and \\nresidential accommodation. The intervention addresses SDG 4 of \\nthe UN SDGs, Agenda 2030. Nationally, it targets activity (ii) of \\nSchedule VII of the Companies Act, 2013.\\nAs part of the impact assessment, a qualitative approach was \\ndeployed to evaluate project progress and analyse areas of \\nimpact emerging out of the interactions with the key stakeholders. \\nA \\xa0sample size of 86 was covered that involved conducting surveys \\nwith the students and their parents and key informant interviews \\n(KIIs) with the Dakshana team and the DMart team as part of the \\nassessment.\\nUnder the project, scholarships are provided to the selected \\nstudents appearing for JEE/NEET exams. The programme has \\nbeen delivered through residential coaching at the Dakshana \\nValley for an academic year. Through the programme, students \\nwere provided with free residential coaching for preparation of \\nJEE and NEET entrance exams; along with access to educational \\nresources. 200 students were sponsored by DMart as part of this \\ninitiative in 2022-23. 82% of the sponsored students qualified \\nfor IIT and 83% of the sponsored students qualified for various \\ngovernment medical colleges in the previous year with the support \\nof Dakshana.\\nNo major challenges related to project execution were reported or \\nobserved. Few challenges reported were lack of practical-based \\nlearning in the course and low adoption of digital resources. The \\nenrolment of girl students, especially for the engineering (JEE) \\ncourse is low owing to societal norms and cultural restrictions \\non female mobility. Recommendations for adopting teaching \\nmethods with a higher focus on practical learning, integrating \\ndigital resources in the course curriculum and ensuring teachers \\ndo not leave mid-session have been given.\\nNavneet 21 Question Paper Set\\nAccess to educational resources is often limited for students \\nfrom low-income families, contributing to educational disparities. \\nProviding question paper sets to government school students for \\ntheir SSC board examinations not only reduces such disparities \\nbut also ensures that all students have access to the tools they \\nneed to succeed academically. It promotes equity and social justice \\nand is a strategic investment in the future prosperity and well-\\nbeing of the nation. Empowering these students and improving \\ntheir educational outcomes will allow them to pursue academic \\nsuccess, thereby opening up opportunities for their future.\\nDMart has been extending support to government school \\nstudents through the distribution of the Navneet 21 Question \\nPaper Set for their 10 th-grade board exam preparation since \\nacademic year 2015-16. The Navneet 21 Question Paper Set is \\na series of question papers published by Navneet Publications, a \\nwell-known publishing house in India. These sets typically consist \\nof a comprehensive collection of question papers in all subjects, \\naligned with the curriculum, designed to help students prepare for \\nboard examinations. The Navneet 21 Question Paper Set serves \\nas a valuable resource for students, offering comprehensive \\ncoverage, diverse question types, and aligned content to support \\nexam preparation and success. DMart spent an amount of ` 1.07 \\ncrore for the academic year 2022-23 on this initiative targeted at \\nthe students at government schools. This intervention addresses \\nSDG 4 of the UN SDGs, Agenda 2030. Nationally, it targets activity \\n(ii) of Schedule VII of the Companies Act, 2013.\\nAs part of the impact assessment, a qualitative approach was \\ndeployed to evaluate project progress and analyse areas of \\nimpact emerging out of the interactions with the key stakeholders \\nA sample size of 253 was covered involving conducting surveys \\nwith the students, and their parents and key informant interviews \\n(KIIs) with the school teachers and the DMart team as part of the \\nassessment.\\nUnder the project, Navneet Question Banks are distributed to \\ngovernment school students to aid SSC board exam preparation. \\nThe Question Banks have been distributed by DMart at the \\nidentified government schools of Mumbai, Thane, Aurangabad, \\nand Kolhapur. 23,235 students were sponsored as part of this \\ninitiative in FY 2022-23.

However, in its efforts to conserve energy, adequate \\nmeasures have been taken in the new and the pre-existing stores. Some of these initiatives are:\\n •   Green Building Certification: We strive to obtain Green Building Certification for our stores under \\nIndian Green Building Council (IGBC) or US Green Building Council (USGBC). A significant effort has been \\nmade throughout a building’s life-cycle from the time of construction to demolition which ensures minimal \\nenvironmental impact. We continued to increase Green Building Certifications for our stores. We have \\nobtained 217 certifications thus far (38 buildings with Gold certification under US GBC LEED, 1 building with \\nGold Certification under Indian GBC LEED, and 178 buildings with Gold Certification under Indian GBC).\\n •   Energy efficient air-conditioning: We use BEE Star rated split air conditioners, which consume less \\nenergy in comparison to conventional air conditioners  We continued using energy efficient inverter air \\nconditioners at select locations.\\n •  Eco-Friendly Speed Breakers: To maintain safe vehicular movement within our premises we install speed \\nbreakers at strategic points. We have installed the speed breakers made up of composite material which \\nhas a combination of recycled plastic, concrete waste and rubber waste. For the year FY 2023-24, we have \\ninstalled 6,631 meters of recycled speed breakers instead of the conventional PVC speed breakers This \\ncumulatively consists of 96% of the total speed breakers installed at our premises last year.\\n•   Hydraulic Baling Press Machines:  We have installed hydraulic baling machines at 255 locations for \\nplastic compaction. These baling machines present multiple benefits like no loose plastic littering, good \\nhygiene and reduced transportation frequency. This initiative helps in reducing the Scope 3 emissions.\\n•   Energy Monitoring Systems (IOT): Our stores are equipped with IOT Ecosystem that helps in monitoring \\nseveral of our energy consuming equipment and recommends basis alerts on early warnings of possible \\nbreakdowns and energy conservation possibilities.\\n•   Natural Gas Generators: Some of our stores have been equipped with Natural Gas Generators  They \\nproduce no particulate matter, relatively lesser emissions and lower noise pollution vis-a-vis diesel generators \\n •   CPCB-IV Compliant Diesel Generator Sets: We have commenced installation of CPCB-IV compliant \\nDiesel Generator Sets at some of our stores. These produce relatively lesser emissions vis-a-vis the previous \\ngeneration of DG’s.\\n•   Retrofit Emissions Control Device (RECD): We continued installation of RECD and Dual Fuel kit for some \\nof our legacy diesel generators at select locations. These devices can capture Particulate Matter Carbon from \\npolluting the air with more than 70% efficiency.\\nFor details please refer ‘Environmental Focus at Dmart’ at page no. 12 of the Annual Report.\\nSteps taken by the \\nCompany for utilising \\nalternate sources of \\nenergy\\nWe have commissioned 36 solar plants in FY 2023-24 with a capacity of 8.2 MW. In total we have 226 solar \\nplants with cumulative capacity of 36.0 MW from these installations. Of the total energy requirement at these \\n226 premises, 24.1% (FY 2022-23: 21.8%) is met through Solar Energy. Subject to on-ground feasibility, it is our \\nendeavour to ensure that all our new premises have a solar plant installed. We have also commenced installing \\nrooftop solar plants at some of our distribution and production centers Further, we have installed car ports at \\n36 stores during the year.

The wastewater generated is treated and reused for flushing toilets in our washrooms. \\nThis helps us to reduce our fresh-water requirement and intake. 36% of our total water usage at these premises is through recycled \\nwater. We estimate to have reduced usage of 154,895 kiloliters of freshwater.\\n  We have also started using Pressure Washers at our premises. Water is released with pressure from the nozzles of this equipment \\nwhich helps in efficient cleaning at significantly lower water consumption. The equipment also has an integrated auto-stop system \\nwhich enhances energy efficiency. Further, we have installed low-flow water efficient fixtures at our stores. These have aerators \\nfixed by default to maintain and regulate water flow. We have developed Rainwater Harvesting system comprising of 386 pits/tanks \\nwith a designed cumulative capacity of 9,694 cubic meters per day.\\n6.

Of the total energy requirement at these 226 premises, 24.1% (PY: 21.8%) \\nis met through Solar Energy. Subject to on-ground feasibility, it is our endeavour to ensure that all our new premises have a solar \\nplant installed. We have also commenced installing rooftop solar plants at some of our distribution and production centers. Further, \\nwe have installed car ports at 36 stores during the year. We have 58 stores in the month of March 2024 that met more than 50% \\nof their total electricity requirement through Solar Energy.\\n  Energy efficient air-conditioning: We use BEE Star rated split air conditioners, which consume less energy in comparison to \\nconventional air conditioners.

For the year FY 2023-24, we have installed 6,631 meters of recycled speed breakers instead of the conventional PVC \\nspeed breakers This cumulatively consists of 96% of the total speed breakers installed at our premises last year.\\n  Installation of Baling Machines: We have installed hydraulic baling machines at 255 locations for plastic compaction. These baling \\nmachines present multiple benefits like no loose plastic littering, good hygiene and also reducing overall trip counts due to higher weight \\nof plastic waste carried per vehicle. This initiative helps in reducing the Scope 3 emissions.\\n  Energy Monitoring Systems (IOT): Our stores are equipped with IOT Ecosystem that helps in monitoring several of our energy \\nconsuming equipment and recommends basis alerts on early warnings of possible breakdowns and energy conservation possibilities.\\n  Natural Gas Generators: Some of our stores have been equipped with Natural Gas Generators. They produce no particulate matter, \\nrelatively lesser emissions and lower noise pollution vis-a-vis diesel generators.\\n  CPCB-IV Compliant Diesel Generator Sets: We have commenced installation of CPCB-IV compliant Diesel Generator Sets at some \\nof our stores. These produce significantly lesser emissions.\\n  Retrofit Emissions Control Device (RECD): We have commenced installation of RECD and Dual Fuel kit for some of our legacy diesel \\ngenerators at select locations.

Reasonable assurance \\nis a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit \\nconducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material \\nmisstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from \\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n116 Independent Auditors’ Report\\n\\nfraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in \\nthe aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence \\nthe economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these \\nstandalone financial statements.\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise \\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism \\nthroughout the audit. We also:\\n• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of \\nthe standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud \\nor error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to \\nthose risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and \\nappropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of \\nnot detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is \\nhigher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve \\ncollusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, \\nor the override of internal control.\\n• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the \\naudit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate \\nin the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we \\nare also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether \\nthe Company has adequate internal financial controls with \\nreference to financial statements in place and the operating \\neffectiveness of such controls.\\n• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used \\nand the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related \\ndisclosures made by management.\\n• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of \\nthe going concern basis of accounting and, based on the \\naudit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty \\nexists related to events or conditions that may cast \\nsignificant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a \\ngoing concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty \\nexists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s \\nreport to the related disclosures in the financial statements \\nor, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. \\nOur conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained \\nup to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events \\nor conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue \\nas a going concern.\\n• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the \\nstandalone financial statements, including the disclosures, \\nand whether the standalone financial statements represent \\nthe underlying transactions and events in a manner that \\nachieves fair presentation.\\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, \\namong other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit \\nand significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies \\nin internal control that we identify during our audit.\\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement \\nthat we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding \\nindependence, and to communicate with them all relationships \\nand other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our \\nindependence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with \\ngovernance, we determine those matters that were of most \\nsignificance in the audit of the standalone financial statements \\nfor the financial year ended 31 st March, 2024 and are therefore \\nthe key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s \\nreport unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure \\nabout the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we \\ndetermine that a matter should not be communicated in our \\nreport because the adverse consequences of doing so would \\nreasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits \\nof such communication.\\nReport on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\\n1.

If any \\nindication exists, or when annual impairment testing for \\nan asset is required, the Company estimates the asset’s \\nrecoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is \\nthe higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) \\nfair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. \\nRecoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, \\nunless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are \\nlargely independent of those from other assets or groups \\nof assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU \\nexceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered \\nimpaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.\\nIn assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows \\nare discounted to their present value using a pre-tax \\ndiscount rate that reflects current market assessments of \\nthe time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. \\nIn determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market \\ntransactions are taken into account.\\nImpairment losses are recognised in the statement of profit \\nand loss, except for properties previously revalued with the \\nrevaluation surplus taken to other comprehensive income.\\nFor assets, an assessment is made at each reporting date \\nto determine whether there is an indication that previously \\nrecognised impairment losses no longer exist or have \\ndecreased. If such indication exists, the Company estimates \\nthe asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously \\nrecognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has \\nbeen a change in the assumptions used to determine the \\nasset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss \\nwas recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying \\namount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, \\nnor exceed the carrying amount that would have been \\ndetermined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss \\nbeen recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is \\nrecognised in the statement of profit or loss unless the asset \\nis carried at a revalued amount, in which case, the reversal is \\ntreated as a revaluation increase.\\n(g) Leases\\nAs per Ind AS 116 “Leases”, the determination of whether \\nan arrangement is (or contains) a lease is based on the \\nsubstance of the arrangement at the inception of the lease. \\nThe arrangement is, or contains, a lease if fulfilment of the \\narrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset \\nor assets and the arrangement conveys a right-of-use the \\nasset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly specified in \\nan arrangement.\\n As a lessee\\nLeases are capitalised at the commencement of the lease \\nat the inception date fair value of the leased property or, if \\nlower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. \\nLease payments are apportioned between finance charges \\nand reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a \\nconstant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the \\nliability. Finance charges are recognised in finance costs \\nin the statement of profit and loss, unless they are directly \\nattributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are \\ncapitalised in accordance with the Company’s general policy \\non the borrowing costs. Contingent rentals are recognised \\nas expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.\\nA leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the \\nasset. However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the \\nCompany will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, \\nthe asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated \\nuseful life of the asset and the lease term.\\nLeases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards \\nof ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as \\noperating leases. Payments made under operating leases \\nare charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss on a \\nstraight-line basis over the period of the lease unless the \\npayments are structured to increase in line with expected \\ngeneral inflation to compensate for the lessor’s expected \\ninflationary cost increases.\\n Depreciation on right-of-use assets\\nDepreciation is provided on straight line method over the useful \\nlife of asset as assessed by the management. Depreciation is \\ncharged on pro-rata basis for asset purchased / sold during \\nthe year. The useful life of depreciation are reviewed and \\nadjusted if appropriate at the end of each reporting period.\\n As a lessor\\nLeases in which the Company does not transfer substantially \\nall the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are \\nclassified as operating leases. Rental income from operating \\nlease is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of \\nthe relevant lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating \\nand arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying \\namount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease\\n\\nNotes\\nto Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\n133\\nAvenue Supermarts Limited | ANNUAL REPORT FY 2023-24\\nterm on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents \\nare recognised as revenue in the period in which they are \\nearned unless the receipts are structured to increase in \\nline with expected general inflation to compensate for the \\nexpected inflationary cost increases.\\nLeases are classified as finance leases when substantially \\nall of the risks and rewards of ownership transfer from the \\nCompany to the lessee. Amounts due from lessees under \\nfinance leases are recorded as receivables at the Company’s \\nnet investment in the leases. Finance lease income is \\nallocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant \\nperiodic rate of return on the net investment outstanding in \\nrespect of the lease.\\n(h) Cash and cash equivalents\\nCash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprises \\ncash at banks and on hand and short term deposits with an \\noriginal maturity of three months or less, which are subject \\nto an insignificant risk of change in value. For the purpose \\nof standalone financial statement of cash flow, cash and \\ncash equivalent consists of cash and short term deposits, \\nas defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts \\nas they are considered an integral part of the Company’s \\ncash management.\\n(i) Trade receivables\\nTrade receivables are initially measured at transaction price \\nexcluding any financing arrangements in sale transactions \\nof the Company.\\n(j) Inventories\\nInventories are valued at lower of cost and net realizable \\nvalue. Cost of inventories, comprise costs of purchase \\nand other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their \\npresent condition and location. Cost is determined by \\nthe weighted average cost method. Costs of purchased \\ninventory are determined after deducting rebates and \\ndiscounts. Net realizable value is the estimated selling \\nprice in the ordinary course of business less the estimated \\ncosts of completion and the estimated cost necessary \\nto make the sale.\\n(k) Financial instruments\\nA Financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a \\nfinancial assets of one entity and a financial liability or equity \\ninstrument of another entity.\\n Financial asset\\n (i) Classification\\nThe Company classifies its financial assets in the \\nfollowing measurement categories:\\n *  those to be measured subsequently at fair value \\n(either through other comprehensive income, or \\nthrough the Statement of Profit and Loss), and\\n * those measured at amortised cost.\\nThe classification depends on the Company’s business \\nmodel for managing the financial assets and the \\ncontractual terms of the cash flows.\\nFor assets measured at fair value, gains and losses \\nwill either be recorded in the Statement of Profit and \\nLoss or other comprehensive income. For investments \\nin debt instruments, this will depend on the business \\nmodel in which the investment is held. For investments \\nin equity instruments, this will depend on whether \\nthe Company has made an irrevocable election at \\nthe time of initial recognition to account for the equity \\ninvestment at fair value through other comprehensive \\nincome. The Company reclassifies debt investments \\nwhen and only when its business model for managing \\nthose assets changes.\\n (ii) Measurement\\nAt initial recognition, the Company measures a financial \\nasset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset \\nnot at fair value through the Statement of Profit and \\nLoss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to \\nthe acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs \\nof financial assets carried at fair value through Profit and \\nLoss are expensed in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\\nFinancial assets with embedded derivatives are \\nconsidered in their entirety when determining \\nwhether their cash flows are solely payment of \\nprincipal and interest.\\n  Debt instruments:\\nSubsequent measurement of debt instruments \\ndepends on the Company’s business model for \\nmanaging the asset and the cash flow characteristics \\nof the asset. There are three measurement categories \\ninto which the Company classifies its debt instruments:\\n*  Amortised cost: A ‘debt instrument’ is measured \\nat the amortised cost if both the following \\nconditions are met:\\na) The asset is held within a business model \\nwhose objective is to hold assets for collecting \\ncontractual cash flows, and\\n\\nNotes\\nto Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n134\\nNotes\\nb) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified \\ndates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal \\nand interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.\\nthis category is the most relevant to the Company. After initial \\nmeasurement, such financial assets are subsequently \\nmeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate \\n(EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into \\naccount any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or \\ncosts that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation \\nis included in finance income in the profit or loss. The losses \\narising from impairment are recognised in the statement of \\nprofit and loss account. This category generally applies to \\ntrade and other receivables.\\n*  Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI): \\nA ‘debt instrument’ is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of \\nthe following criteria are met:\\na) The objective of the business model is achieved both \\nby collecting contractual cash flows and selling the \\nfinancial assets, and\\nb) The asset’s contractual cash flows represent SPPI.\\nDebt instruments included within the FVTOCI category \\nare measured initially as well as at each reporting date \\nat fair value. Fair value movements are recognised in \\nthe other comprehensive income (OCI). However, the \\nCompany recognizes interest income, impairment \\nlosses & reversals and foreign exchange gain or \\nloss in the statement of profit and loss account. \\nOn derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or \\nloss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from \\nthe equity to statement of profit and loss account. \\nInterest earned whilst holding FVTOCI debt instrument \\nis reported as interest income using the EIR method.\\n *  Fair value through profit and loss: FVTPL is a residual \\ncategory for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, \\nwhich does not meet the criteria for categorisation as at \\namortised cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL. \\nIn addition, the Company may elect to designate a debt \\ninstrument, which otherwise meets amortised cost or \\nFVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election \\nis allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a \\nmeasurement or recognition inconsistency (referred \\nto as ‘accounting mismatch’). The Company has \\nnot designated any debt instrument as at FVTPL. \\nDebt instruments included within the FVTPL category \\nare measured at fair value with all changes recognised \\nin the Statement of Profit and Loss.\\n  Equity instruments:\\nThe Company subsequently measures all equity \\ninvestments at fair value. Where the Company’s \\nmanagement has elected to present fair value gains and \\nlosses on equity investments in other comprehensive \\nincome, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair \\nvalue gains and losses to the Statement of Profit and \\nLoss. Dividends from such investments are recognised \\nin the Statement of Profit and Loss as other income \\nwhen the Company’s right to receive payments \\nis established.\\nChanges in the fair value of financial assets at fair \\nvalue through the Statement of Profit and Loss are \\nrecognised in other income / other expenses in the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss. Impairment losses (and \\nreversal of impairment losses) on equity investments \\nmeasured at FVTOCI are not reported separately from \\nother changes in fair value.\\n (iii) Impairment of financial assets\\nThe Company assesses on a forward looking basis \\nthe expected credit losses associated with its \\nassets carried at amortised cost and FVTOCI debt \\ninstruments. The impairment methodology applied \\ndepends on whether there has been a significant \\nincrease in credit risk.\\nFor trade receivables only, the Company applies the \\nsimplified approach permitted by Ind AS 109 Financial \\nInstruments, which requires expected lifetime losses to \\nbe recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.\\n (iv) Derecognition of financial assets\\nA financial asset is derecognised only when\\n*  the Company has transferred the rights to receive \\ncash flows from the financial asset or\\n*  retains the contractual rights to receive the \\ncash flows of the financial asset, but assumes a \\ncontractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or \\nmore recipients.\\nWhere the Company has transferred an asset, \\nthe Company evaluates whether it has transferred \\nsubstantially all risks and rewards of the financial asset. \\nIn such cases, the financial asset is derecognised. \\nWhere the Company has not transferred substantially \\nall risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, \\nthe financial asset is not derecognised.\\n\\nNotes\\nto Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\n135\\nAvenue Supermarts Limited | ANNUAL REPORT FY 2023-24\\nWhere the Company has neither transferred a financial \\nasset nor retains substantially all risks and rewards of \\nownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is \\nderecognised if the Company has not retained control \\nof the financial asset. Where the Company retains \\ncontrol of the financial asset, the asset is continued to \\nbe recognised to the extent of continuing involvement \\nin the financial asset.\\n Financial liabilities\\n (i) Offsetting financial instruments\\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net \\namount is reported in the balance sheet where there \\nis a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised \\namounts and there is an intention to settle on a \\nnet basis or realise the asset and settle the liability \\nsimultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not \\nbe contingent on future events and must be enforceable \\nin the normal course of business and in the event of \\ndefault insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company or \\nthe counterparty.\\n (ii) Trade and other payables\\nThese amount represent liabilities for goods and \\nservices provided to the Company prior to the end \\nof financial year which are unpaid. The amounts are \\nunsecured. Trade and other payables are presented as \\ncurrent liabilities unless payment is not due within 12 \\nmonths after the reporting period. They are recognised \\ninitially at their fair value and subsequently measured \\nat amortised cost using the effective interest method.\\n (iii) Borrowings and other financial liabilities\\nBorrowings and other financial liabilities are initially \\nrecognised at fair value (net of transaction costs \\nincurred). Difference between the fair value and the \\ntransaction proceeds on initiation is recognised as \\nan asset / liability based on the underlying reason \\nfor the difference. Subsequently all financial liabilities \\nare measured at amortised cost using the effective \\ninterest rate method.\\nBorrowings are removed from the balance sheet when \\nthe obligation specified in the contract is discharged, \\ncancelled or expired. The difference between the \\ncarrying amount of a financial liability that has been \\nextinguished or transferred to another party and the \\nconsideration paid, including any non-cash transferred \\nor liabilities assumed, is recognised in the Statement of \\nProfit and Loss.\\nBorrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the \\nCompany has an unconditional right to defer settlement \\nof the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting \\nperiod. Where there is a breach of a material provision \\nof a long-term loan arrangement on or before the end \\nof the reporting period with the effect that the liability \\nbecomes payable on demand on the reporting date, \\nthe entity does not classify the liability as current, if the \\nlender agreed, after the reporting period and before the \\napproval of the financial statements for issue, not to \\ndemand payment as a consequence of the breach.\\n (iv) Borrowing costs\\nGeneral and specific borrowing costs that are directly \\nattributable to the acquisition or construction of \\nqualifying assets are capitalised during the period \\nof time that is required to complete and prepare the \\nasset for its intended use. Other borrowing costs are \\nexpensed in the period in which they are incurred.\\nInvestment income earned on the temporary investment \\nof specific borrowings pending their expenditure on \\nqualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs \\neligible for capitalisation.\\nBorrowing cost consist of interest and other cost that \\nan entity incurs in connection with borrowing of funds.\\n (v) Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\\nProvisions are recognised when the Company has a \\npresent legal or constructive obligation as a result of \\npast events, it is probable that an outflow of resources \\nembodying economic benefit will be required to settle \\nthe obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.\\nProvisions are measured at the present value of \\nmanagement’s best estimate of the expenditure \\nrequired to settle the present obligation at the end of the \\nreporting period. The discount rate used to determine \\nthe present value is a pre tax rate that reflects current \\nmarket assessments of the time value of money and \\nthe risks specific to the liability. The increase in the \\nprovision due to the passage of time is recognised \\nas finance cost.\\nContingent Liabilities are disclosed in respect of \\npossible obligations that arise from past events but \\ntheir existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or \\nnon occurrence of one or more uncertain future events \\nnot wholly within the control of the Company or where \\nany present obligation cannot be measured in terms of \\nfuture outflow of resources or where a reliable estimate \\nof the obligation cannot be made.\\nA contingent asset is disclosed, where an inflow of \\neconomic benefits is probable. An entity shall not\\n\\nNotes\\nto Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n136\\nNotes\\nrecognize a contingent asset unless the recovery is \\nvirtually certain.\\n(l) Revenue Recognition\\nRevenue from operations is recognised to the extent that it is \\nprobable that economic benefit will flow to the Company and \\nthe revenue can be reliably measured regardless of when the \\npayment is being made as per IND AS 115.\\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognised when \\nthe control/title of the goods or services are transferred to \\nthe customer at an amount of transaction price allocated to \\nthat performance obligation that reflects the consideration \\nto which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange \\nfor those goods or services excluding government duties \\ncollected on behalf of the Government.In determining the \\ntransaction price of goods sold and services rendered, the \\nCompany excludes the effect of any variable consideration \\non account of various discounts and schemes offered by the \\nCompany as a part of the Contract.\\nIt is the Company’s policy to sell its products to the \\nend customers with the right of return of 7 days. \\nHistorical experience is used to estimate and provide for \\nsuch returns at the time of sale.\\nThe Company has generally concluded that it is the principal \\nin its revenue arrangements, except for the agency services \\nbelow, because it typically controls the goods or services \\nbefore transferring them to the customer.\\n Principal versus agent consideration\\nThe inventory of third party does not pass to the Company \\ntill the product is sold. At the time of sale of such inventory, \\nthe sales value along with the cost of inventory is disclosed \\nseprately as sale of goods on approval basis and cost of \\ngoods sold on approval basis and forms part of Revenue \\nin the Statement of Profit and Loss. Only the net revenue \\nearned i.e. margin is recorded as a part of revenue.\\n Rental income\\nRental income arising from operating lease on investment \\nproperties is accounted for on a straight line basis over \\nlease terms unless the receipts are structured to increase \\nin line with expected general inflation to compensate for the \\nexpected inflationary cost increases and is included in the \\nStatement of profit and loss due to its operating nature.\\n Interest income\\nInterest income is recongnised based on time proportion \\nbasis considering the amount outstanding and rate \\napplicable (EIR). Interest income in included in the Other \\nIncome in the statement of Profit and Loss.\\n(m) Retirement and other employee benefits\\n (i) Short-term obligations\\nLiabilities for wages and salaries, including \\nnon-monetary benefits that are expected to be settled \\nwholly within 12 months after the end of the period \\nin which the employees render the related service \\nare recognised in respect of employees’ services up \\nto the end of the reporting period and are measured \\nat the amounts expected to be paid when the \\nliabilities are settled.\\nRetirement benefit in the form of provident fund is \\na defined contribution plan. The Company has no \\nobligation , other than the contribution payable to the \\nprovident fund. The Company recognises contribution \\npayable to the provident fund scheme as an expense, \\nwhen an employee renders the related services. If the \\nContribution payable to the scheme for service received \\nbefore the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution \\nalready paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is \\nrecognised as a liability after deducting the contribution \\nalready paid. If the contribution already paid exceeds \\nthe contribution due for services received before the \\nbalance sheet date,then excess is recognised as an \\nasset to the extent that the prepayment will lead to a \\nreduction in future payment or a cash refund.\\n ii) Other long-term employee benefit obligations\\nThe liabilities for earned leave and sick leave that are \\nnot expected to be settled wholly within 12 months \\nare measured at the present value of expected future \\npayments to be made in respect of services provided \\nby employees up to the end of the reporting period \\nusing the projected unit credit method. The benefits are \\ndiscounted using the Government Securities (G-Sec) \\nat the end of the reporting period that have terms \\napproximating to the terms of the related obligation. \\nRemeasurements as a result of experience adjustments \\nand changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised \\nin the Statement of Profit and Loss.\\nThe obligations are presented as current liabilities \\nin the balance sheet if the entity does not have an \\nunconditional right to defer settlement for at least \\ntwelve months after the reporting period, regardless of \\nwhen the actual settlement is expected to occur.\\n iii) Post-employment obligations\\n  Defined benefit plans\\n  Gratuity\\nThe liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet \\nin respect of defined benefit gratuity plans is the \\npresent value of the defined benefit obligation at the \\nend of the reporting period less the fair value of plan\\n\\nNotes\\nto Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\n137\\nAvenue Supermarts Limited | ANNUAL REPORT FY 2023-24\\nassets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated \\nannually by independent actuary using the projected \\nunit credit method. The present value of the defined \\nbenefit obligation denominated in INR is determined \\nby discounting the estimated future cash outflows by \\nreference to market yields at the end of the reporting \\nperiod on government bonds that have terms \\napproximating to the terms of the related obligation.\\nThe net interest cost is calculated by applying the \\ndiscount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit \\nobligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is \\nincluded in employee benefit expense in the Statement \\nof Profit and Loss. Remeasurement gains and losses \\narising from experience adjustments and changes in \\nactuarial assumptions are recognised in the period \\nin which they occur, directly in other comprehensive \\nincome. They are included in retained earnings in the \\nstatement of changes in equity and in the balance \\nsheet. Changes in the present value of the defined \\nbenefit obligation resulting from plan amendments \\nor curtailments are recognised immediately in the \\nStatement of profit and loss as past service cost.\\n  Share based payment\\nEquity settled share based payments to employees \\nand other providing similar services are measured at \\nfair value of the equity instruments at grant date.\\nThe fair value determined at the grant date of the \\nequity-settled share based payment is expensed on a \\nstraight line basis over the vesting period, based on \\nthe Company’s estimate of equity instruments that will \\neventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity. \\nAt the end of each reporting period , the Company \\nrevises its estimates of the number of equity instruments \\nexpected to vest. The impact of the revision of the \\noriginal estimates, if any is , recongised in Statement \\nof Profit and Loss such that the cumulative expenses \\nreflects the revised estimate,with a corresponding \\nadjustment to the shared option outstanding account.\\nNo expense is recognised for options that do not \\nultimately vest because non market performance \\nand/or service conditions have not been met.\\nThe dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as \\nadditional share dilution in the computation of diluted \\nearnings per share.\\nExpense relating to options granted to employees of the \\nsubsidiaries under the Company’s share based payment \\nplan, is recovered from the subsidiaries. Such recovery \\nis reduced from employee benefit expense.\\n(n) Foreign currency transactions\\n (a) Functional and presentation currency:\\nItems included in the financial statements of the \\nCompany are measured using the currency of the \\nprimary economic environment in which the entity \\noperates. The standalone financial statements \\nare presented in INR, which is functional and \\npresentational currency.\\n (b) Transaction and balances :\\nTransaction in currencies other than than entity’s \\nfunctional currency (foreign currencies) are recognised \\nat the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of \\nthe transaction.\\nExchange differences arising on settlement or \\ntranslation of monetary items are recognised in the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss.\\nNon monetary items carried at fair value that are \\ndenominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at \\nthe rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was \\ndetermined. Non-monetary items that are measured in \\nterms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not \\nretranslated. The gain or loss arising on translation of \\nnon-monetary items measured at fair value is treated \\nin line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the \\nchange in fair value of the item.\\n(o) Income tax\\n a) Current Tax\\nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities are measured \\nat the amount expected to be recovered from or paid \\nto the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws \\nused to compute the amount are those that enacted \\nor substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the \\ncountries where The Company operates and generates \\ntaxable income.\\n b) Deferred tax\\nDeferred income tax is provided using the liability \\nmethod on temporary differences arising between the \\ntax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying \\namount for financial reporting purpose at the reporting \\ndate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined \\nusing tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or \\nsubstantially enacted by the end of the reporting period \\nand are expected to apply when the asset is realised or \\nthe liability is settled.\\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible \\ntemporary differences and unused tax losses, only if, it \\nis probable that future taxable amounts will be available \\nto utilise those temporary differences and losses.\\n\\nNotes\\nto Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n138\\nNotes\\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there \\nis a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets \\nand liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate \\nto the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and \\ntax liabilities are off set where The Company has a \\nlegally enforceable right to offset and intends either to \\nsettle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle \\nthe liability simultaneously.\\nCurrent and deferred tax is recognised in the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss, except to the extent that \\nit relates to items recognised in other comprehensive \\nincome or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also \\nrecognised in other comprehensive income or directly \\nin equity, respectively\\n(p) Earnings Per Share\\n Basic earnings per share\\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing:\\n- the profit attributable to equity shareholder of the  \\nCompany\\n- by the weighted average number of equity shares \\noutstanding during the financial year\\n Diluted earnings per share\\nDiluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the \\ndetermination of basic earnings per share to take into \\naccount:\\n- the after income tax effect of interest and other \\nfinancing costs associated with dilutive potential \\nequity shares, and\\n- the weighted average number of additional equity \\nshares that would have been outstanding assuming \\nthe conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.\\n(q) Fair value measurement\\nThe Company measures financial instrument at fair value at \\neach Balance sheet date.\\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell assets \\nor paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between \\nmarket participant at the measurement date.\\xa0\\nThe fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are \\nincluded at the amount at which the instrument could be \\nexchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, \\nother than in a forced or liquidation sale.\\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to \\nestimate the fair values:\\n1. Fair value of cash and deposits, trade and other \\nreceivables, trade payables and other current liabilities, \\napproximate their carrying amounts largely due to short \\nterm maturities of these instruments.\\n2. The fair values of non-current borrowings are based \\non discounted cash flows using a current borrowing \\nrate. They are classified as level 3 fair values in the fair \\nvalue hierarchy due to the use of unobservable inputs, \\nincluding own credit risk.\\n3. For financial assets and liabilities that are measured \\nat fair value, the carrying amounts are equal to \\nthe fair values.\\nThe Company uses the following hierarchy for determining \\nand disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by \\nvaluation technique:\\nLevel 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for \\nidentical assets or liabilities.\\nLevel 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a \\nsignificant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, \\neither directly or indirectly.\\nLevel 3: techniques which use inputs that have a significant \\neffect on the recorded fair value that are not based on \\nobservable market data.\\n(r)  Significant accounting judgement, estimates and \\nassumption\\nThe preparation of standalone financial statements requires \\nthe use of accounting estimates which by definition \\nwill seldom equal the actual results. Management also \\nneed to exercise judgement in applying the Company’s \\naccounting policies.\\n Share based payment\\nThe Company initially measures the cost of equity \\nsettled transaction with employees using Black Scholes \\nmodel to determine the fair value of the liability incurred. \\nEstimating fair value for share-based payment transaction \\nrequires determination of the most appropriate valuation \\nmodel, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of \\nthe grant. The estimates also requires determination of the \\nmost appropriate inputs to the valuation model including \\nexpected life of the share option, volatility and dividend yield\\n\\nNotes\\nto Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\n139\\nAvenue Supermarts Limited | ANNUAL REPORT FY 2023-24\\nand making assumptions about them.For equity settled \\nshare based payment transaction, the liability needs to be \\nre-measured at the end of each reporting period upto the \\ndate of settlement, with any changes in fair value recognised \\nin the Statement of Profit and Loss. This requires a \\nre-assessment of the estimates used at end of each reporting \\nperiod. The assumption and models used for estimating the \\nfair value for share based-payment transaction are disclosed \\nin note no. 43.\\n Provision for inventory\\nThe Company has calculated the provision for inventory \\nbasis the percentage as per historical experience for \\ninventory lying from the last inventory count date to the \\nreporting date.\\nAn inventory provision is also recognised for cases where the \\nrealisable value is estimated to be lower than the inventory \\ncarrying value. The inventory provision is estimated taking \\ninto account various factors, including prevailing sales \\nprices of inventory item, the seasonality of the item’s sales \\nprofile and losses associated with obsolete / slow-moving \\ninventory items.\\n Defined benefit plans (gratuity benefits)\\nThe cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and other \\npost-employment medical benefits and the present value \\nof the gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial \\nvaluations. An actuarial valuation involves making various \\nassumptions that may differ from actual developments in \\nthe future. These include the determination of the discount \\nrate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the \\ncomplexities involved in the valuation and its long-term \\nnature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to \\nchanges in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed \\nat each reporting date.\\nThe parameter most subject to change is the discount \\nrate.

A fall in the discount rate generally increases the mark to market value of the assets depending on \\nthe duration of asset.\\nSalary risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of members. \\nAs such, an increase in the salary of the members more than assumed level will increase the plan’s liability.\\nInvestment risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined \\nby reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds. If the return on plan asset is below this \\nrate, it will create a plan deficit. Currently, for the plan in India, it has a relatively balanced mix of investments in government \\nsecurities and other debt instruments.\\n165\\nAvenue Supermarts Limited | ANNUAL REPORT FY 2023-24\\n\\nNotes\\nto Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\nAsset liability matching risk: The plan faces the ALM risk as to the matching cash flow. Since the plan is invested in lines of \\nrule 101 of Income Tax Rules, 1962, this generally reduces ALM risk.\\nMortality risk: Since the benefits under the plan is not payable for life time and payable till retirement age only, plan does not \\nhave any longevity risk.\\nConcentration risk: Plan is having a concentration risk as all the assets are invested with the insurance Companies.\\n45   FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\\n Financial risk management objectives and policies\\nThe Company’s financial principal liabilities comprises lease liabilities, trade payables and other payables.

We believe that the audit evidence we have \\nobtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our \\naudit opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\\nKey Audit Matters\\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional \\njudgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated \\nfinancial statements for the financial year ended 31st March, 2024. \\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the \\nconsolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our \\nopinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on \\nthese matters. For each matter below, our description of how our \\naudit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\\nWe have determined the matters described below to be the key \\naudit matters to be communicated in our report. We have fulfilled \\nthe responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for \\nthe audit of the consolidated financial statements section of our \\nreport, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our \\naudit included the performance of procedures designed to \\nrespond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement \\nof the consolidated financial statements. The results of \\naudit procedures performed by us and by other auditors of \\ncomponents not audited by us, as reported by them in their audit \\nreports furnished to us by the management, including those \\nprocedures performed to address the matters below, provide the \\nbasis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated \\nfinancial statements.\\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n172 Independent Auditors’ Report\\n\\nKey audit matters How our audit addressed the key audit matter\\nCapital expenditure in respect of land and buildings \\n(as described in note 1.c and 2 of the consolidated financial statements)\\nThe Holding Company has incurred significant expenditure on \\npurchase/construction of land and building as reflected by the total \\nvalue of additions in property, plant and equipment and capital work in \\nprogress in notes 2 in the consolidated financial statements.\\nThe Holding Company is in the process of constructing new stores \\nacross locations for which land has been purchased and buildings are \\nbeing constructed. These stores take substantial period of time to get \\nready for its intended use.\\nWe considered capital expenditure in respect of land and building as a \\nKey audit matter due to significance of amount incurred on such items \\nduring the year. \\nOur audit procedures included the following:\\nWe obtained understanding, evaluated the design and tested the \\noperating effectiveness of controls related to capital expenditure of land \\nand buildings.\\nWe obtained the list of land parcels purchased during the year and \\ntraced the amounts of capitalisation with the title deeds and traced \\nthe expenses capitalised along with the land cost to the underlying \\ninvoices.\\nFor samples selected, we obtained the approvals of the authorised \\nsignatory for the purchase of land parcel.\\nWe performed control testing on a sample basis for each element of \\ncapitalised costs of building and reconciliation of material performed by \\nmanagement including verification of underlying supporting evidence \\nand understanding nature of the costs capitalised.\\nWe compared the total cost of addition of sample stores with \\nmanagement budgets.\\nWe obtained understanding on management assessment relating to \\nprogress of projects and their intention to bring the asset to its intended \\nuse.\\nInventory existence and allowance for inventory \\n(as described in note 1.k and 1.s of the consolidated financial statements)\\nAs at 31st March, 2024, the carrying amount of inventories amounted \\nto ` 3,927.31 crore after considering allowances for Inventory \\ntowards shrinkage and slow moving inventory of ` 58.10 crore. These \\ninventories are held at the stores and distribution centers of the Group.\\nThe management undertakes the physical verification of inventory at \\nperiodic intervals during the year and shrinkages if any are recorded \\nin the books. The total amount of shrinkage and damage recorded \\nduring the year amounts to ` 173.67 crore\\nBasis the actual shrinkages recorded, the management estimates the \\nexpected allowance for Inventory shrinkage from the date of the last \\nphysical verification till the balance sheet date.\\nFurther, there are a number of judgements required in assessing \\nthe appropriate level of allowance for slow moving inventory. Such \\njudgements include management’s expectations of forecast inventory \\ndemand, product expiry dates and plans to dispose of inventories that \\nare close to expiry.\\nConsidering the wide spread inventory of the Group and the \\njudgements applied for determining the allowance, we consider the \\nexistence and allowance for inventories to be a key audit matter.\\nOur procedures over existence and allowance for inventory included \\nthe following:\\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the \\noperating effectiveness of controls that the Group has in relation to the \\ninventory count process and allowance for inventory;\\nWe performed testing on the Group’s controls over the inventory count \\nprocess. In testing these controls we observed the inventory count \\nprocess at selected store and distribution centers on a sample basis, \\ninspected the results of the inventory count and confirmed variances \\nincluding damaged and shrinkages were accounted for and approved \\nby management.\\nAssessed the stock shrinkage provision by assessing the level of \\ninventory write downs during the period and applying the shrinkage \\nrate as determined location wise to the year end stock. We tested on a \\nsample basis the shrinkage rate used to calculate the provision for each \\nstore and distribution center.\\nWe evaluated the assumptions made by management, and particularly \\nthe key assumption that in assessing stock obsolescence provisions \\nthrough an analysis of inventory items by category and age and the \\nlevel of inventory write downs in these categories during the period\\nWe assessed the Group’s disclosures concerning this in Note 1.k and \\n1.s on significant accounting estimates and judgements and Note 10 \\nInventories to the consolidated financial statements\\nWe have determined that there are no other key audit matters to communicate in our report.\\n173\\nAvenue Supermarts Limited | ANNUAL REPORT FY 2023-24\\n\\nOther than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report \\nThereon\\nThe Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for \\nthe other information.

If, based on the work we have performed, \\nwe conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other \\ninformation, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing \\nto report in this regard.\\nResponsibilities of Management for the Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements\\nThe Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for \\nthe preparation and presentation of these consolidated financial \\nstatements in terms of the requirements of the Act that give a true \\nand fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated \\nfinancial performance including other comprehensive income, \\nconsolidated cash flows and consolidated statement of changes \\nin equity of the Group in accordance with the accounting principles \\ngenerally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting \\nStandards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read \\nwith the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, \\nas amended. The respective Board of Directors of the companies \\nincluded in the Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate \\naccounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for \\nsafeguarding of the assets of their respective companies and for \\npreventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection \\nand application of appropriate accounting policies; making \\njudgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and \\nthe design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal \\nfinancial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the \\naccuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant \\nto the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial \\nstatements that give a true and fair view and are free from material \\nmisstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been \\nused for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial \\nstatements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.\\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective \\nBoard of Directors of the companies included in the Group are \\nresponsible for assessing the ability of their respective companies \\nto continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, \\nmatters related to going concern and using the going concern \\nbasis of accounting unless management either intends to \\nliquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic \\nalternative but to do so.\\nThose respective Board of Directors of the companies included \\nin the Group are also responsible for overseeing the financial \\nreporting process of their respective companies.\\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements\\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether \\nthe consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from \\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue \\nan auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance \\nis a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit \\nconducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material \\nmisstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from \\nfraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in \\nthe aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence \\nthe economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these \\nconsolidated financial statements.\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise \\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism \\nthroughout the audit. We also:\\n• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the \\nconsolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or \\nerror, design and perform audit procedures responsive to \\nthose risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and \\nappropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of \\nnot detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is \\nhigher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve \\ncollusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, \\nor the override of internal control.\\n• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the \\naudit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate \\nin the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we \\nare also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether \\nthe Holding Company has adequate internal financial \\ncontrols with reference to financial statements in place and \\nthe operating effectiveness of such controls.\\n• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used \\nand the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related \\ndisclosures made by management.\\n• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of \\nthe going concern basis of accounting and, based on the \\naudit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty \\nexists related to events or conditions that may cast significant \\ndoubt on the ability of the Group to continue as a going \\nconcern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we \\nare required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the \\nrelated disclosures in the consolidated financial statements \\nor, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. \\nOur conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained \\nup to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events \\nor conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as \\na going concern.\\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n174 Independent Auditors’ Report\\n\\n• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the \\nconsolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, \\nand whether the consolidated financial statements represent \\nthe underlying transactions and events in a manner that \\nachieves fair presentation.\\n• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the \\nfinancial information of the entities or business activities \\nwithin the Group of which we are the independent auditors \\nand whose financial information we have audited, to express \\nan opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are \\nresponsible for the direction, supervision and performance of \\nthe audit of the financial statements of such entities included \\nin the consolidated financial statements of which we are the \\nindependent auditors. For the other entities included in the \\nconsolidated financial statements, which have been audited \\nby other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible \\nfor the direction, supervision and performance of the audits \\ncarried out by them. We remain solely responsible for \\nour audit opinion.\\nWe communicate with those charged with governance of \\nthe Holding Company and such other entities included in the \\nconsolidated financial statements of which we are the independent \\nauditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope \\nand timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including \\nany significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify \\nduring our audit.\\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement \\nthat we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding \\nindependence, and to communicate with them all relationships \\nand other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our \\nindependence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with \\ngovernance, we determine those matters that were of most \\nsignificance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements \\nfor the financial year ended 31 st March, 2024 and are therefore \\nthe key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s \\nreport unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure \\nabout the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we \\ndetermine that a matter should not be communicated in our \\nreport because the adverse consequences of doing so would \\nreasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits \\nof such communication.\\nOther Matter\\nWe did not audit the financial statements and other financial \\ninformation, in respect of 3 subsidiaries, whose financial \\nstatements include total assets of ` 88.68 crore as at 31st March, \\n2024, and total revenues of ` 182.06 crore and net cash inflows \\nof ` 1.09 crore for the year ended on that date.

We conducted our audit in \\naccordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial \\nControls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the \\nStandards on Auditing, specified under section 143(10) of the Act, \\nto the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, \\nboth, issued by ICAI.

Our audit of internal financial controls \\nwith reference to consolidated financial statements included \\nobtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with \\nreference to consolidated financial statements, assessing the \\nrisk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating \\nthe design and operating effectiveness of internal control based \\non the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the \\nauditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of \\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due \\nto fraud or error.\\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the \\naudit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their \\nreports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is \\nsufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion \\non the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated \\nfinancial statements.\\nMeaning of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\nA company’s internal financial control with reference to \\nconsolidated financial statements is a process designed to \\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial \\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external \\npurposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting \\nprinciples. A company’s internal financial control with reference \\nto consolidated financial statements includes those policies and \\nprocedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in \\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and \\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable \\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to \\npermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with \\ngenerally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and \\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance \\nwith authorisations of management and directors of the company; \\nand (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or \\ntimely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition \\nof the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the \\nfinancial statements.\\nInherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls With \\nReference to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls \\nwith reference to consolidated financial statements, including \\nthe possibility of collusion or improper management override of \\ncontrols, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur \\nand not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the \\ninternal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial \\nstatements to future periods are subject to the risk that the \\ninternal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial \\nstatements may become inadequate because of changes in \\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or \\nprocedures may deteriorate.\\nOpinion\\nIn our opinion, the Group , which are companies incorporated \\nin India, have, maintained in all material respects, adequate \\ninternal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial \\nstatements and such internal financial controls with reference to \\nconsolidated financial statements were operating effectively as \\nat 31st March,2024, based on the internal control over financial \\nreporting criteria established by the Holding Company considering \\nthe essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance \\nNote issued by the ICAI.\\nOther Matters\\nOur report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy \\nand operating effectiveness of the internal financial controls with \\nreference to consolidated financial statements of the Holding \\nCompany, in so far as it relates to these three subsidiaries, \\nwhich are companies incorporated in India, is based on the \\ncorresponding reports of the auditors of such subsidiaries \\nincorporated in India.\\nFor S R B C & CO LLP\\nChartered Accountants\\nICAI Firm Registration Number: 324982E/E300003\\nper Vikram Mehta\\nPartner\\nMembership No.: 105938\\nUDIN: 24105938BKELXL3455\\nThane, 4th May, 2024\\n179\\nAvenue Supermarts Limited | ANNUAL REPORT FY 2023-24'),\n",

The consolidated \\nfinancial statements comprises the financial statement of the \\nHolding Company and its susidiaries, together are referred to \\nas “the Group”.\\nThe consolidated financial statements have been recommended \\nfor approval by the audit committee and is approved and adopted \\nby the Board in their meeting held at Thane, 4th May, 2024.\\n1. SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\n(a) Statement of compliance and basis of preparation\\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared \\nin accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards \\n(hereinafter referred to as the ‘Ind AS’) as notified by \\nMinistry of Corporate Affairs pursuant to Section 133 of the \\nCompanies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’) read with the Companies \\n(Indian Accounting standards) Rules as amended from time \\nto time and other relevant provisions of the Act\\nThe accounting policies are applied consistently to all the \\nperiods presented in the consolidated financial statements.\\n (i) Historical cost convention\\nThe consolidated financial statements have been \\nprepared on a historical cost basis, except for the \\nfollowing:\\n1) certain financial assets and liabilities that are \\nmeasured at fair value;\\n2) defined benefit plans - plan assets measured at \\nfair value;\\n3) share based payments.\\n (ii) Current non-current classification\\nThe Group presents assets and liabilities in the balance \\nsheet based on current and non-current classification. \\nAs asset is treated as current when it is:\\n- Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or \\nconsumed in normal operating cycle\\n- Held primarily for the purpose of trading\\n- Expected to be realised within twelve months \\nafter the reporting period, or\\n- Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from \\nbeing exchanged or used to settle a liability for at \\nleast twelve months after the reporting period\\nAll other assets are classified as non-current.\\nA liability is current when:\\n- It is expected to be settled in normal operating \\ncycle\\n- It is held primarily for the purpose of trading\\n- It is due to be settled within twelve months after \\nthe reporting period, or\\n- There is no unconditional right to defer the \\nsettlement of the liability for at least twelve months \\nafter the reporting period.\\nThe Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current.\\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as \\nnon-current assets and liabilities.\\nThe operating cycle is the time between the acquisition \\nof assets for processing and their realisation in cash \\nand cash equivalents. The Group has identified twelve \\nmonths as its operating cycle.\\n (iii) Rounding off amounts\\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented \\nin ` and all values are rounded to the nearest ` 0.00 \\ncrores , except when otherwise indicated.\\n (iv) Going Concern\\nThe Group has prepared the financial statements on the \\nbasis that it will continue to operate as a going concern.\\n(b ) Basis of consolidation\\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial \\nstatements of the holding company and its subsidiaries as \\nat 31st March, 2024. Control is achieved when the Group is \\nexposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement \\nwith the investee and has the ability to affect those returns \\nthrough its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group \\ncontrols an investee if and only if the Group has:\\n- Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give \\nit the current ability to direct the relevant activities \\nof the investee)\\n\\nNotes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\n187\\nAvenue Supermarts Limited | ANNUAL REPORT FY 2023-24\\n- Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its \\ninvolvement with the investee, and\\n- The ability to use its power over the investee to affect \\nits returns Generally, there is a presumption that a \\nmajority of voting rights result in control. To support \\nthis presumption and when the Group has less \\nthan a majority of the voting or similar rights of an \\ninvestee, the Group considers all relevant facts and \\ncircumstances in assessing whether it has power over \\nan investee, including:\\n- The contractual arrangement with the other vote \\nholders of the investee\\n- Rights arising from other contractual arrangements \\n- The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights\\n- The size of the Group’s holding of voting rights relative \\nto the size and dispersion of the holdings of the other \\nvoting rights holders\\nThe Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee \\nif facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to \\none or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation \\nof a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over \\nthe subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control \\nof the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses \\nof a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are \\nincluded in the consolidated financial statements from the \\ndate the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases \\nto control the subsidiary. \\nConsolidated financial statements are prepared using \\nuniform accounting policies for like transactions and other \\nevents in similar circumstances. If a member of the Group \\nuses accounting policies other than those adopted in the \\nconsolidated financial statements for like transactions and \\nevents in similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments \\nare made to that Group member’s financial statements in \\npreparing the consolidated financial statements to ensure \\nconformity with the Group’s accounting policies.\\nThe financial statements of all entities used for the purpose \\nof consolidation are drawn up to same reporting date as \\nthat of the Holding company, i.e., year ended on 31 st March, \\n2024. When the end of the reporting period of the holding \\ncompany is different from that of a subsidiary, the subsidiary \\nprepares, for consolidation purposes, additional financial \\ninformation as of the same date as the financial statements \\nof the holding company to enable the holding company to \\nconsolidate the financial information of the subsidiary, unless \\nit is impracticable to do so.\\n Consolidation procedure:\\n(a) Combine like items of assets, liabilities, equity, \\nincome, expenses and cash flows of the holding \\ncompany with those of its subsidiary. For this \\npurpose, income and expenses of the subsidiary are \\nbased on the amounts of the assets and liabilities \\nrecognised in the consolidated financial statements at \\nthe acquisition date.\\n(b) Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of the Holding \\ncompany investment in each subsidiary and the \\nHolding company’s portion of equity of each subsidiary. \\nBusiness combinations policy explains how to account \\nfor any related goodwill.\\n(c) Eliminate in full intraGroup assets and liabilities, \\nequity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to \\ntransactions between entities of the Group (profits \\nor losses resulting from intraGroup transactions that \\nare recognised in assets, such as inventory and fixed \\nassets, are eliminated in full). IntraGroup losses may \\nindicate an impairment that requires recognition in the \\nconsolidated financial statements. Ind AS 12 Income \\nTaxes applies to temporary differences that arise from \\nthe elimination of profits and losses resulting from \\nintraGroup transactions.\\nProfit or loss and each component of other \\ncomprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the \\nequity holders of the holding of the Group and to \\nthe non-controlling interests, even if this results in \\nthe non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. \\nWhen necessary, adjustments are made to the financial \\nstatements of subsidiary to bring their accounting \\npolicies into line with the Group’s accounting policies. \\nAll intra-Group assets and liabilities, equity, income, \\nexpenses and cash flows relating to transactions \\nbetween members of the Group are eliminated in full \\non consolidation.\\nA change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, \\nwithout a loss of control, is accounted for as an \\nequity transaction. If the Group loses control over a \\nsubsidiary, it:\\n- Derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and \\nliabilities of the subsidiary\\n- Derecognises the carrying amount of any \\nnon-controlling interests \\n- Derecognises the cumulative translation \\ndifferences recorded in equity\\n\\nNotes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n188\\nNotes\\n- Recognises the fair value of the \\nconsideration received \\n- Recognises the fair value of any investment \\nretained \\n- Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss \\n- Reclassifies the Holding company share of \\ncomponents previously recognised in OCI to \\nprofit or loss or retained earnings, as appropriate, \\nas would be required if the Group had directly \\ndisposed of the related assets or liabilities.\\n(c) Property, plant and equipment (PPE)\\nFreehold land is carried at historical cost. All other item of \\nproperty, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost \\nless depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that is \\ndirectly attributable to the acquisition of items.\\nCapital work-in-progress , property, plant and equipment is \\nstated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Such cost \\nincludes the cost of replacing part of the property, plant and \\nequipment if the recognition criteria are met. When significant \\nparts of property, plant and equipment are required to be \\nreplaced at intervals, The Group depreciates them separately \\nbased on thier specific useful lifes. Likewise, when a major \\ninspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the \\ncarrying amount of the property, plant and equipment as a \\nreplacement if the recongnition criteria are satisfied. All other \\nrepairs and maintenance costs are recognised in profit or \\nloss as incurred.\\nCapital work-in-progress comprises cost of property, plant \\nand equipment (including related expenses), that are not yet \\nready for their intended use at the reporting date.\\nSubsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount \\nor recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when \\nit is probable that future economic benefits associated with \\nthe item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be \\nmeasured reliably. The carrying amount of any component \\naccounted for as a separate asset is derecognised when \\nreplaced. All other repairs and maintenance are charged \\nto profit or loss during the reporting period in which \\nthey are incurred.\\n Depreciation on property, plant and equipment\\nDepreciation is provided to the extent of depreciable amount \\non written down value method (except for leasehold land \\nwhich is amortised over the period of lease) over the useful \\nlife of asset as assessed by the management and the same is \\nsimilar to the useful lives as prescribed in Part-C of Schedule \\nII to the Companies Act, 2013. Depreciation is charged on \\npro-rata basis for asset purchased / sold during the year.\\nThe assets residual values, useful life and method of \\ndepreciation of property plant & equipment are reviewed and \\nadjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.\\n(d) Business combinations and goodwill\\nThe Group has accounted business combinations using the \\nacquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured \\nas the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured \\nat acquisition date fair value. Acquisition-related costs are \\nexpensed as incurred.\\nAt the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and \\nthe liabilities assumed are recognised at their acquisition \\ndate fair values.\\nIf the business combination is achieved in stages, any \\npreviously held equity interest is re-measured at its acquisition \\ndate fair value and any resulting gain or loss is recognised in \\nprofit or loss or OCI, as appropriate.\\nGoodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the \\naggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount \\nrecognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous \\ninterest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and \\nliabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired \\nis in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the \\nGroup re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of \\nthe assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and \\nreviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be \\nrecognised at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still \\nresults in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired \\nover the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain \\nis recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity as capital \\nreserve. However, if there is no clear evidence of bargain \\npurchase, the entity recognises the gain directly in equity as \\ncapital reserve, without routing the same through OCI.\\nAfter initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less \\nany accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose \\nof impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business \\ncombination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each \\nof the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to \\nbenefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other \\nassets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.\\nA cash generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated \\nis tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when \\nthere is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the \\nrecoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than \\nits carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first\\n\\nNotes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\n189\\nAvenue Supermarts Limited | ANNUAL REPORT FY 2023-24\\nto reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to \\nthe unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata \\nbased on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. \\nAny impairment loss for goodwill is recognised in profit \\nor loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not \\nreversed in subsequent periods.\\n(e) Intangible assets\\nIntangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial \\nrecognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired \\nin a business combination is their fair value at the date of \\nacquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets \\nare carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation \\nand accumulated impairment losses.Intangible assets are \\namortised on a straight line method basis over the economic \\nuseful life estimated by the management.\\nIntangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful \\neconomic life and assessed for impairment whenever there \\nis an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. \\nThe amortisation period and the amortisation method for \\nan intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at \\nleast at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the \\nexpected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption \\nof future economic benefits embodied in the asset are \\nconsidered to modify the amortisation period or method, \\nas appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting \\nestimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets \\nwith finite lives is recognised in the statement of profit and \\nloss unless such expenditure forms part of carrying value \\nof another asset.\\nGains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible \\nasset are measured as the difference between the net \\ndisposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and \\nare recognised in the statement of profit or loss when the \\nasset is derecognised.\\n Amortisation on intangible assets\\nAmortisation is provided on straight line method over the \\nuseful life of asset as assessed by the management and the \\nsame is similar to the useful lives as prescribed in Part-C \\nof Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013. Amortisation is \\ncharged on pro-rata basis for asset purchased / sold during \\nthe year. The residual value, useful life and method of \\namortisation of intangible assets are reviewed and adjusted \\nif appropriate at the end of each reporting period\\n Estimated useful life of assets are as follows:\\n Computer Software - 5 years\\n Trademarks - 5 - 10 years\\n(f) Investment properties\\nInvestments in property that are not intended to be occupied \\nsubstantially for use by, or in the operations of the Group, have \\nbeen classified as investment property. Investment properties \\nare measured initially at its cost including transaction cost \\nand where applicable borrowing costs. Subsequent to initial \\nrecognition, investment properties are stated at cost less \\naccumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment \\nloss, if any. Subsequent cost are included in the assets \\ncarrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as \\nappropriate, only when it is probable that future economic \\nbenefits associated with the item will flow to the Group \\nand the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other \\nrepairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during \\nthe reporting period in which they are incurred.\\nThough the Group measures investment property using cost \\nbased measurement, the fair value of investment property is \\ndisclosed in the notes. Fair values are determined based on \\nan annual evaluation performed by an accredited external \\nindependent valuer applying a valuation model recommended \\nby the International Valuation Standards Committee.\\nThe Group depreciates its investment properties \\nover the useful life which is similar to that of Property, \\nPlant and Equipment.\\nInvestment properties are derecognised either when they \\nhave been disposed of or when they are permanently \\nwithdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is \\nexpected from their disposal. The difference between the \\nnet disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset \\nis recognised in profit or loss in the period of derecognition.\\n(g) Impairment of non financial assets\\nThe Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is \\nan indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication \\nexists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset \\nis required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable \\namount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an \\nasset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs \\nof disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is \\ndetermined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not \\ngenerate cash inflows that are largely independent of those \\nfrom other assets or Groups of assets. When the carrying \\namount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, \\nthe asset is considered impaired and is written down to its \\nrecoverable amount.\\nIn assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows \\nare discounted to their present value using a pre-tax\\n\\nNotes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n190\\nNotes\\ndiscount rate that reflects current market assessments of \\nthe time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. \\nIn determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market \\ntransactions are taken into account.\\nImpairment losses are recognised in the statement of profit \\nand loss, except for properties previously revalued with the \\nrevaluation surplus taken to other comprehensive income.\\nFor assets, an assessment is made at each reporting date \\nto determine whether there is an indication that previously \\nrecognised impairment losses no longer exist or have \\ndecreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates \\nthe asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously \\nrecognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has \\nbeen a change in the assumptions used to determine the \\nasset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss \\nwas recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying \\namount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, \\nnor exceed the carrying amount that would have been \\ndetermined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss \\nbeen recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is \\nrecognised in the statement of profit or loss unless the asset \\nis carried at a revalued amount, in which case, the reversal is \\ntreated as a revaluation increase.\\n(h) Leases\\nAs per IND AS 116 “Leases”, the determination of whether \\nan arrangement is (or contains) a lease is based on the \\nsubstance of the arrangement at the inception of the lease. \\nThe arrangement is, or contains, a lease if fulfilment of the \\narrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset \\nor assets and the arrangement conveys a right -of- use the \\nasset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly specified in \\nan arrangement.\\n As a lessee\\nLeases are capitalised at the commencement of the lease \\nat the inception date fair value of the leased property or, if \\nlower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. \\nLease payments are apportioned between finance charges \\nand reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a \\nconstant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the \\nliability. Finance charges are recognised in finance costs \\nin the statement of profit and loss, unless they are directly \\nattributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are \\ncapitalised in accordance with the company’s general policy \\non the borrowing costs. Contingent rentals are recognised \\nas expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.\\nA leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. \\nHowever, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group \\nwill obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset \\nis depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of \\nthe asset and the lease term.\\nLeases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards \\nof ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as \\noperating leases. Payments made under operating leases \\nare charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss on a \\nstraight-line basis over the period of the lease unless the \\npayments are structured to increase in line with expected \\ngeneral inflation to compensate for the lessor’s expected \\ninflationary cost increases.\\n Depreciation on right-of-use assets\\nDepreciation is provided on straight line method over \\nthe useful life of asset as assessed by the management. \\nDepreciation is charged on pro-rata basis for asset \\npurchased / sold during the year. The useful life of \\ndepreciation are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at \\nthe end of each reporting period.\\n As a lessor\\nLeases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all \\nthe risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are classified \\nas operating leases. Rental income from operating lease \\nis recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the \\nrelevant lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating \\nand arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying \\namount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease \\nterm on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents \\nare recognised as revenue in the period in which they are \\nearned unless the receipts are structured to increase in \\nline with expected general inflation to compensate for the \\nexpected inflationary cost increases. \\nLeases are classified as finance leases when substantially \\nall of the risks and rewards of ownership transfer from the \\nCompany to the lessee. Amounts due from lessees under \\nfinance leases are recorded as receivables at the Company’s \\nnet investment in the leases. Finance lease income is \\nallocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant \\nperiodic rate of return on the net investment outstanding in \\nrespect of the lease.\\n(i) Cash and cash equivalents\\nCash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprises \\ncash at banks and on hand and short term deposits with an \\noriginal maturity of three months or less, which are subject \\nto an insignificant risk of change in value. For the purpose \\nof consolidated financial statement of cash flow, cash and \\ncash equivalent consists of cash and short term deposits, \\nas defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts \\nas they are considered an integral part of The Group’s \\ncash management.\\n\\nNotes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\n191\\nAvenue Supermarts Limited | ANNUAL REPORT FY 2023-24\\n(j) Trade receivables\\nTrade receivables are initially measured at transaction \\nprice excluding any financing arrangements in sale \\ntransactions of the Group.\\n(k) Inventories\\nInventories are valued at lower of cost and net realizable \\nvalue. Cost of inventories, comprise costs of purchase \\nand other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their \\npresent condition and location. Cost is determined by \\nthe weighted average cost method. Costs of purchased \\ninventory are determined after deducting rebates and \\ndiscounts. Net realizable value is the estimated selling \\nprice in the ordinary course of business less the estimated \\ncosts of completion and the estimated cost necessary \\nto make the sale.\\n(l) Financial instruments\\nA Financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a \\nfinancial assets of one entity and a financial liability or equity \\ninstrument of another entity.\\n Financial asset\\n (i) Classification\\nThe Group classifies its financial assets in the following \\nmeasurement categories:\\n*  those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either \\nthrough other comprehensive income, or through the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss), and\\n* those measured at amortised cost.\\nThe classification depends on The Group’s business \\nmodel for managing the financial assets and the \\ncontractual terms of the cash flows.\\nFor assets measured at fair value, gains and losses \\nwill either be recorded in the Statement of Profit and \\nLoss or other comprehensive income. For investments \\nin debt instruments, this will depend on the business \\nmodel in which the investment is held. For investments \\nin equity instruments, this will depend on whether the \\nGroup has made an irrevocable election at the time of \\ninitial recognition to account for the equity investment \\nat fair value through other comprehensive income. \\nThe Group reclassifies debt investments when and \\nonly when its business model for managing those \\nassets changes.\\n (ii) Measurement\\nAt initial recognition, The Group measures a financial \\nasset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial \\nasset not at fair value through the Statement of \\nProfit and Loss, transaction costs that are directly \\nattributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. \\nTransaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value \\nthrough the Statement of Profit and Loss are expensed \\nin the Statement of Profit and Loss.\\nFinancial assets with embedded derivatives are \\nconsidered in their entirety when determining \\nwhether their cash flows are solely payment of \\nprincipal and interest.\\n Debt instruments:\\nSubsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on \\nThe Group’s business model for managing the asset and \\nthe cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three \\nmeasurement categories into which The Group classifies its \\ndebt instruments:\\n*  Amortised cost: A ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the \\namortised cost if both the following conditions are met:\\na) The asset is held within a business model whose \\nobjective is to hold assets for collecting contractual \\ncash flows, and\\nb) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified \\ndates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal \\nand interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.\\nThis category is the most relevant to The Group. After initial \\nmeasurement, such financial assets are subsequently \\nmeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest \\nrate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking \\ninto account any discount or premium on acquisition and \\nfees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR \\namortisation is included in finance income in the profit or \\nloss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in \\nthe profit or loss. This category generally applies to trade and \\nother receivables.\\n*  Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI): \\nA ‘debt instrument’ is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of \\nthe following criteria are met:\\na) The objective of the business model is achieved both \\nby collecting contractual cash flows and selling the \\nfinancial assets, and\\nb) The asset’s contractual cash flows represent SPPI.\\nDebt instruments included within the FVTOCI category \\nare measured initially as well as at each reporting date at \\nfair value. Fair value movements are recognised in the \\nother comprehensive income (OCI). However, The Group\\n\\nNotes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n192\\nNotes\\nrecognizes interest income, impairment losses & reversals and \\nforeign exchange gain or loss in the P&L. On derecognition \\nof the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised \\nin OCI is reclassified from the equity to P&L. Interest earned \\nwhilst holding FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest \\nincome using the EIR method.\\n*  Fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL): FVTPL is a \\nresidual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, \\nwhich does not meet the criteria for categorisation as at \\namortised cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.\\nIn addition, The Group may elect to designate a debt \\ninstrument, which otherwise meets amortised cost or \\nFVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election \\nis allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a \\nmeasurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as \\n‘accounting mismatch’). The Group has not designated any \\ndebt instrument as at FVTPL.\\nDebt instruments included within the FVTPL category are \\nmeasured at fair value with all changes recognised in the P&L.”\\n Equity instruments:\\nThe Group subsequently measures all equity investments \\nat fair value. Where The Group’s management has \\nelected to present fair value gains and losses on equity \\ninvestments in other comprehensive income, there is no \\nsubsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses \\nto the Statement of Profit and Loss. Dividends from such \\ninvestments are recognised in the Statement of Profit and \\nLoss as other income when The Group’s right to receive \\npayments is established.\\nChanges in the fair value of financial assets at fair value \\nthrough the Statement of Profit and Loss are recognised in \\nother income / other expenses in the Statement of Profit and \\nLoss. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) \\non equity investments measured at FVTOCI are not reported \\nseparately from other changes in fair value.\\n (iii) Impairment of financial assets\\nThe Group assesses on a forward looking basis \\nthe expected credit losses associated with its \\nassets carried at amortised cost and FVTOCI debt \\ninstruments. The impairment methodology applied \\ndepends on whether there has been a significant \\nincrease in credit risk.\\nFor trade receivables only, the Group applies the \\nsimplified approach permitted by Ind AS 109 Financial \\nInstruments, which requires expected lifetime losses to \\nbe recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.\\n (iv) Derecognition of financial assets\\nA financial asset is derecognised only when\\n*  The Group has transferred the rights to receive cash \\nflows from the financial asset or\\n*  retains the contractual rights to receive the \\ncash flows of the financial asset, but assumes a \\ncontractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or \\nmore recipients.\\nWhere the Group has transferred an asset, the Group \\nevaluates whether it has transferred substantially all \\nrisks and rewards of the financial asset. In such cases, \\nthe financial asset is derecognised. Where the Group \\nhas not transferred substantially all risks and rewards \\nof ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset \\nis not derecognised.\\nWhere the Group has neither transferred a financial \\nasset nor retains substantially all risks and rewards of \\nownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is \\nderecognised if the Group has not retained control of \\nthe financial asset. Where the Group retains control \\nof the financial asset, the asset is continued to be \\nrecognised to the extent of continuing involvement in \\nthe financial asset.\\n  Financial Liabilities\\n  (i) Offsetting financial instruments\\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the \\nnet amount is reported in the balance sheet \\nwhere there is a legally enforceable right to offset \\nthe recognised amounts and there is an intention \\nto settle on a net basis or realise the asset and \\nsettle the liability simultaneously. The legally \\nenforceable right must not be contingent on \\nfuture events and must be enforceable in the \\nnormal course of business and in the event of \\ndefault insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group or \\nthe counterparty.\\n  (ii) Trade and other payables\\nThese amounts represent liabilities for goods \\nand services provided to the Group prior to \\nthe end of financial year which are unpaid. \\nThe amounts are unsecured. Trade and other \\npayables are presented as current liabilities \\nunless payment is not due within 12 months \\nafter the reporting period. They are recognised \\ninitially at their fair value and subsequently \\nmeasured at amortised cost using the effective \\ninterest method.\\n\\nNotes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\n193\\nAvenue Supermarts Limited | ANNUAL REPORT FY 2023-24\\n  (iii) Borrowings and other financial liabilities\\nBorrowings and other financial liabilities are initially \\nrecognised at fair value (net of transaction costs \\nincurred). Difference between the fair value and the \\ntransaction proceeds on initiation is recognised as \\nan asset / liability based on the underlying reason \\nfor the difference. Subsequently all financial \\nliabilities are measured at amortised cost using \\nthe effective interest rate method.\\nBorrowings are removed from the balance sheet \\nwhen the obligation specified in the contract is \\ndischarged, cancelled or expired. The difference \\nbetween the carrying amount of a financial \\nliability that has been extinguished or transferred \\nto another party and the consideration paid, \\nincluding any non-cash transferred or liabilities \\nassumed, is recognised in the Statement of \\nProfit and Loss.\\nBorrowings are classified as current liabilities \\nunless The Group has an unconditional right \\nto defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 \\nmonths after the reporting period. Where there is \\na breach of a material provision of a long-term \\nloan arrangement on or before the end of the \\nreporting period with the effect that the liability \\nbecomes payable on demand on the reporting \\ndate, the entity does not classify the liability as \\ncurrent, if the lender agreed, after the reporting \\nperiod and before the approval of the financial \\nstatements for issue, not to demand payment as \\na consequence of the breach.\\n  (iv) Borrowing costs\\nGeneral and specific borrowing costs that \\nare directly attributable to the acquisition or \\nconstruction of qualifying assets are capitalised \\nduring the period of time that is required to \\ncomplete and prepare the asset for its intended \\nuse. Other borrowing costs are expensed in the \\nperiod in which they are incurred.\\nInvestment income earned on the temporary \\ninvestment of specific borrowings pending their \\nexpenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from \\nthe borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.\\nBorrowing cost consist of interest and other \\ncost that an entity incurs in connection with \\nborrowing of funds.\\n  (v)  Provisions, contingent liabilities and contigent \\nassets\\nProvisions are recognised when The Group has a \\npresent legal or constructive obligation as a result \\nof past events, it is probable that an outflow of \\nresources embodying economic benefit will be \\nrequired to settle the obligation and the amount \\ncan be reliably estimated.\\nProvisions are measured at the present value of \\nmanagement’s best estimate of the expenditure \\nrequired to settle the present obligation at the end \\nof the reporting period. The discount rate used \\nto determine the present value is a pre tax rate \\nthat reflects current market assessments of the \\ntime value of money and the risks specific to the \\nliability. The increase in the provision due to the \\npassage of time is recognised as finance cost.\\nContingent Liabilities are disclosed in respect \\nof possible obligations that arise from past \\nevents but their existence will be confirmed by \\nthe occurrence or non occurrence of one or \\nmore uncertain future events not wholly within \\nthe control of The Group or where any present \\nobligation cannot be measured in terms of future \\noutflow of resources or where a reliable estimate \\nof the obligation cannot be made.\\nA contingent asset is disclosed, where an inflow \\nof economic benefits is probable. An entity shall \\nnot recognize a contingent asset unless the \\nrecovery is virtually certain.\\n(m) Revenue Recognition\\nRevenue from operations is recognised to the extent that it \\nis probable that economic benefit will flow to the Group and \\nthe revenue can be reliably measured regardless of when the \\npayment is being made as per IND AS 115.\\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognised when \\nthe control/title of the goods or services are transferred to \\nthe customer at an amount of transaction price allocated to \\nthat performance obligation that reflects the consideration \\nto which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange \\nfor those goods or services excluding government duties \\ncollected on behalf of the Government.In determining the \\ntransaction price of goods sold and services rendered, the \\nGroup excludes the effect of any variable consideration on \\naccount of various discounts and schemes offered by the \\nGroup as a part of the Contract.\\n\\nNotes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n194\\nNotes\\nIt is the Group’s policy to sell its products to the end customers \\nwith the right of return of 7 days. Historical experience is used \\nto estimate and provide for such returns at the time of sale.\\nThe Group has generally concluded that it is the principal \\nin its revenue arrangements, except for the agency services \\nbelow, because it typically controls the goods or services \\nbefore transferring them to the customer.\\n Principal versus agent consideration\\nThe inventory of third party does not pass to the Group till \\nthe product is sold. At the time of sale of such inventory, \\nthe sales value along with the cost of inventory is disclosed \\nseprately as sale of goods on approval basis and cost of \\ngoods sold on approval basis and forms part of Revenue \\nin the Statement of Profit and Loss. Only the net revenue \\nearned i.e. margin is recorded as a part of revenue.\\n Rental income\\nRental income arising from operating lease on investment \\nproperties is accounted for on a straight line basis over \\nlease terms unless the receipts are structured to increase \\nin line with expected general inflation to compensate for the \\nexpected inflationary cost increases and is included in the \\nStatement of profit or loss due to its operating nature.\\n Interest income\\nInterest income is recognised based on time proportion basis \\nconsidering the amount outstanding and using effective \\ninterest rate applicable (EIR). Interest income is included in \\nthe Other Income in the statement of Profit and Loss.\\n(n) Retirement and other employee benefits\\n (i) Short-term obligations\\nLiabilities for wages and salaries, including \\nnon-monetary benefits that are expected to be settled \\nwholly within 12 months after the end of the period \\nin which the employees render the related service \\nare recognised in respect of employees’ services up \\nto the end of the reporting period and are measured \\nat the amounts expected to be paid when the \\nliabilities are settled.\\nRetirement benefit in the form of provident fund is a \\ndefined contribution plan. The Group has no obligation \\n, other than the contribution payable to the provident \\nfund. The Group recognises contribution payable \\nto the provident fund scheme as an expense, when \\nan employee renders the related services. If the \\nContribution payable to the scheme for service received \\nbefore the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution \\nalready paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is \\nrecognised as a liability after deducting the contribution \\nalready paid. If the contribution already paid exceeds \\nthe contribution due for services received before the \\nbalance sheet date,then excess is recognised as an \\nasset to the extent that the prepayment will lead to a \\nreduction in future payment or a cash refund.\\n ii) Other long-term employee benefit obligations\\nThe liabilities for earned leave and sick leave that are \\nnot expected to be settled wholly within 12 months \\nare measured at the present value of expected future \\npayments to be made in respect of services provided \\nby employees up to the end of the reporting period \\nusing the projected unit credit method. The benefits are \\ndiscounted using the Government Securities (G-Sec) \\nat the end of the reporting period that have terms \\napproximating to the terms of the related obligation. \\nRemeasurements as a result of experience adjustments \\nand changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised \\nin the Statement of Profit and Loss.\\nThe obligations are presented as current liabilities \\nin the balance sheet if the entity does not have an \\nunconditional right to defer settlement for at least \\ntwelve months after the reporting period, regardless of \\nwhen the actual settlement is expected to occur.\\n iii) Post-employment obligations\\n  Defined benefit plans\\n  Gratuity\\nThe liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet \\nin respect of defined benefit gratuity plans is the \\npresent value of the defined benefit obligation at the \\nend of the reporting period less the fair value of plan \\nassets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated \\nannually by independent actuary using the projected \\nunit credit method. The present value of the defined \\nbenefit obligation denominated in INR is determined \\nby discounting the estimated future cash outflows by \\nreference to market yields at the end of the reporting \\nperiod on government bonds that have terms \\napproximating to the terms of the related obligation.\\nThe net interest cost is calculated by applying the \\ndiscount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit \\nobligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is \\nincluded in employee benefit expense in the Statement \\nof Profit and Loss. Remeasurement gains and losses \\narising from experience adjustments and changes in \\nactuarial assumptions are recognised in the period \\nin which they occur, directly in other comprehensive \\nincome. They are included in retained earnings in the \\nstatement of changes in equity and in the balance \\nsheet.

The impact of the revision of the \\noriginal estimates, if any is , recongised in Statement \\nof Profit and Loss such that the cumulative expenses \\nreflects the revised estimate,with a corresponding \\nadjustment to the shared option outstanding account.\\nNo expense is recognised for options that do not \\nultimately vest because non market performance \\nand/or service conditions have not been met.\\nThe dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as \\nadditional share dilution in the computation of diluted \\nearnings per share.\\nExpense relating to options granted to employees of the \\nsubsidiaries under The Group’s share based payment \\nplan, is recovered from the subsidiary. Such recovery is \\nreduced from employee benefit expense.\\n(o) Foreign currency transactions\\n (a) Functional and presentation currency:\\nItems included in the financial statements of The \\nGroup are measured using the currency of the primary \\neconomic environment in which the entity operates. \\nThe Consolidated Financial statements are presented \\nin INR, which is functional and presentational currency.\\n (b) Transaction and balances :\\nTransaction in currencies other than than entity’s \\nfunctional currency (foreign currencies) are recognised \\nat the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of \\nthe transaction.\\nExchange differences arising on settlement or \\ntranslation of monetary items are recognised in the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss.\\nNon monetary items carried at fair value that are \\ndenominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at \\nthe rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was \\ndetermined. Non-monetary items that are measured in \\nterms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not \\nretransalated. The gain or loss arising on translation of \\nnon-monetary items measured at fair value is treated \\nin line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the \\nchange in fair value of the item.\\n(p) Income Tax\\n a) Current Tax\\nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities are measured \\nat the amount expected to be recovered from or paid \\nto the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws \\nused to compute the amount are those that enacted \\nor substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the \\ncountries where the Group operates and generates \\ntaxable income.\\n b) Deferred tax\\nDeferred income tax is provided using the liability \\nmethod on temporary differences arising between the \\ntax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying \\namount for financial reporting purpose at the reporting \\ndate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined \\nusing tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or \\nsubstantially enacted by the end of the reporting period \\nand are expected to apply when the asset is realised or \\nthe liability is settled.\\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible \\ntemporary differences and unused tax losses, only if, it \\nis probable that future taxable amounts will be available \\nto utilise those temporary differences and losses.\\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there \\nis a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets \\nand liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate \\nto the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and \\ntax liabilities are off set where the Group has a legally \\nenforceable right to offset and intends either to settle \\non a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the \\nliability simultaneously.\\nCurrent and deferred tax is recognised in the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss, except to the extent that \\nit relates to items recognised in other comprehensive \\nincome or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also \\nrecognised in other comprehensive income or directly \\nin equity, respectively.\\n\\nNotes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n196\\nNotes\\n(q) Earnings Per Share\\n Basic earnings per share\\n Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing:\\n- the profit attributable to equity shareholder of the Group\\n- by the weighted average number of equity shares \\noutstanding during the financial year\\n Diluted earnings per share\\nDiluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the \\ndetermination of basic earnings per share to take into account:\\n- the after income tax effect of interest and other \\nfinancing costs associated with dilutive potential \\nequity shares, and\\n- the weighted average number of additional equity \\nshares that would have been outstanding assuming \\nthe conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.\\n(r) Fair value measurement\\nThe Group measures financial instrument at fair value at \\neach Balance sheet date.\\nFair value is the price that would received to sell an assets or \\npaid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between \\nmarket participant at the measurment date.\\nThe fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are \\nincluded at the amount at which the instrument could be \\nexchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, \\nother than in a forced or liquidation sale.\\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to \\nestimate the fair values:\\n1. Fair value of cash and deposits, trade and other \\nreceivables, trade payables, other current liabilities, \\napproximate their carrying amounts largely due to short \\nterm maturities of these instruments.\\n2. For financial assets and liabilities that are measured \\nat fair value, the carrying amounts are equal to \\nthe fair values.\\nThe Group uses the following hierarchy for determining \\nand disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by \\nvaluation technique:\\nLevel 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for \\nidentical assets or liabilities.\\nLevel 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a \\nsignificant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, \\neither directly or indirectly.\\nLevel 3: techniques which use inputs that have a significant \\neffect on the recorded fair value that are not based on \\nobservable market data.\\n(s)  Significant accounting judgement, estimates and \\nassumption\\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires \\nthe use of accounting estimates which by definition will seldom \\nequal the actual results. Management also need to exercise \\njudgement in applying The Group’s accounting policies.\\n Share based payment\\nThe Group initially measures the cost of equity settled \\ntransaction with employees using Black Scholes model \\nto determine the fair value of the liability incurred. \\nEstimating fair value for share-based payment transacton \\nrequires determination of the most appropriate valuation \\nmodel, which is dependent on the terms and conditions \\nof the grant. The estimates also requires determination \\nof the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model \\nincluding expected life of the share option, volatility and \\ndividend yield and making assumptions about them.For \\nequity settled share based payment transaction, the liability \\nneeds to be re-measured at the end of each reporting \\nperiod upto the date of settlement, with any changes in \\nfair value recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. \\nThis requires a re-assessment of the estimates used at \\nend of each reporting period. The assumption and models \\nused for estimating the fair value for share based-payment \\ntransaction are disclosed in note no 45.\\n Provision for inventory\\nThe Group has calculated the provision for inventory basis \\nthe percentage as per historical experience for inventory \\nlying from the last inventory count date to the reporting date.\\nAn inventory provision is also recognised for cases where the \\nrealisable value is estimated to be lower than the inventory \\ncarrying value. The inventory provision is estimated taking \\ninto account various factors, including prevailing sales \\nprices of inventory item, the seasonality of the item’s sales \\nprofile and losses associated with obsolete / slow-moving \\ninventory items.\\n Defined benefit plans (gratuity benefits)\\nThe cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and other \\npost-employment medical benefits and the present value \\nof the gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial\\n\\nNotes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\n197\\nAvenue Supermarts Limited | ANNUAL REPORT FY 2023-24\\nvaluations. An actuarial valuation involves making various \\nassumptions that may differ from actual developments in \\nthe future. These include the determination of the discount \\nrate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the \\ncomplexities involved in the valuation and its long-term \\nnature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to \\nchanges in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed \\nat each reporting date.\\nThe parameter most subject to change is the discount \\nrate. In determining the appropriate discount rate for plans \\noperated in India, the management considers the interest \\nrates of government bonds in currencies consistent with the \\ncurrencies of the post-employment benefit obligation.\\nThe mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality \\ntables for the specific countries. Those mortality tables \\ntend to change only at interval in response to demographic \\nchanges. Future salary increases and gratuity increases are \\nbased on expected future inflation rates.\\nFurther details about gratuity obligations are given in note \\nno: 46.\\n(t) Segment reporting\\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with \\nthe internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision \\nmaker being Managing Director of The Group . The Managing \\nDirector assesses the financial performance and position of \\nThe Group as a whole, and makes strategic decisions.\\n(u) Cash flow\\nThe investing and financing activities in cash flow statement \\ndo not have a direct impact on current cash flows although \\nthey do affect the capital and asset structure of an entity. \\nThe Group has disclosed these transactions, to the extent \\nmaterial, in notes to consolidated cash flow statement.\\n\\nNotes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\n2 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\\n(` in Crores)\\nFreehold land \\n(Refer note : \\n2,6,7)\\nBuildings \\n(Refer \\nnote : \\n1,4,5)\\nLeasehold \\nimprovement\\nPlant and \\nequipment\\nComputers Furniture \\nand \\nfixtures\\nVehicles Office \\nequipment\\nElectrical \\ninstallations\\nTotal\\nCost\\nBalance as at \\n1st April, 2022\\n 3,691.13  3,942.02  107.78  462.67  152.61  443.39  3.44  73.31  328.99  9,205.34 \\nAdditions  877.77  1,087.40  24.22  162.48  40.41  104.42  13.47  12.47  99.74  2,422.38 \\nDisposals  -    0.54  3.13  10.44  2.88  5.95  2.13  1.25  2.69  29.01 \\nBalance as at \\n31st March, 2023\\n 4,568.90  5,028.88  128.87  614.71  190.14  541.86  14.78  84.53  426.04  11,598.71 \\nAdditions  1,274.82  774.29  11.64  214.67  33.98  126.70  3.42  17.59  121.61  2,578.72 \\nDisposals  -    0.02  7.71  8.03  4.99  7.72  0.88  5.58  3.34  38.27 \\nBalance as at \\n31st March, 2024\\n 5,843.72  5,803.15  132.80  821.35  219.13  660.84  17.32  96.54  544.31  14,139.16 \\nDepreciation\\nBalance as at \\n1st April, 2022\\n -    652.01  63.25  181.76  110.66  214.30  2.54  42.74  167.62  1,434.88 \\nCharge for the \\nyear\\n -    184.72  22.54  73.55  31.57  73.24  10.77  9.06  54.14  459.59 \\nDisposals  -    0.17  1.61  8.47  2.65  4.17  1.66  1.10  1.54  21.37 \\nBalance as at \\n31st March, 2023\\n -    836.56  84.18  246.84  139.58  283.37  11.65  50.70  220.22  1,873.10 \\nCharge for the \\nyear\\n -    224.96  16.76  94.38  33.16  79.73  8.52  10.29  65.85  533.65 \\nDisposals  -    0.01  4.65  6.33  4.58  5.05  3.82  0.79  1.55  26.78 \\nBalance as at \\n31st March, 2024\\n -    1,061.51  96.29  334.89  168.16  358.05  16.35  60.20  284.52  2,379.97 \\nNet book value\\nBalance as at \\n31st March, 2023\\n 4,568.90  4,192.32  44.69  367.87  50.56  258.49  3.13  33.83  205.82  9,725.61 \\nBalance as at \\n31st March, 2024\\n 5,843.72  4,741.64  36.51  486.46  50.97  302.79  0.97  36.34  259.79  11,759.19 \\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n198\\nNotes\\n\\nNotes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\nNote:\\n1 Building includes following amounts for construction under built operate and transfer (BOT) arrangement .\\n(` in Crores)\\nParticulars As at  \\n31st March, 2024\\nAs at  \\n31st March, 2023\\nOpening Balance   45.24  40.98 \\nAddition during the year  1.02  4.26 \\nGross block  46.26  45.24 \\nNet block  31.28  31.89 \\n2 Freehold land includes ` 699.73 Crores (31 st March, 2023 : ` 595.76 Crores) being  property purchased, for which mutation is pending.\\n3 Details of Capital work in progress -\\n(` in Crores)\\nParticulars As at  \\n31st March, 2024\\nAs at  \\n31st March, 2023\\nOpening Balance  829.16  1,129.34 \\nAdditions during the year  1,143.46  1,089.06 \\nTransfer during the year  (1,037.40)  (1,389.24)\\nClosing Balance  935.22  829.16 \\n a) Capital work in progress ageing schedule\\n(` in Crores)\\nParticulars Less than 1 year 1- 2  years 2- 3  years more than 3 \\nyears\\nTotal\\nProject in progress  598.93  106.96  207.74  21.59  935.22 \\nProject temporarily suspended  -    -    -    -    -   \\nBalance as at 31 st March, 2024  598.93  106.96  207.74  21.59  935.22 \\nProject in progress  450.27  290.84  36.37  51.68  829.16 \\nProject temporarily suspended  -    -    -    -    -   \\nBalance as at 31 st March, 2023  450.27  290.84  36.37  51.68  829.16 \\nb) All the upcoming projects of the Group are within the timelines as estimated during the original plan and the actual cost of projects are within \\nthe total cost as estimated by the management of the Group as on 31 st March, 2024.\\n4 No assets are pledged as security for borrowings.\\n5 Building includes Net book value of plant and equipment fitting of ` 14.00 Crores (31 st March, 2023 : ` 17.56 Crores).\\n6 Freehold Land includes one property at Bhamti Nagar, Nagpur of ` 10.65 crores as at 31 st March, 2024 (31 st March, 2023: ` 10.65 crores) \\npurchased by the Holding Company.

Rate will increase the present value of the liability \\nrequiring higher provision. A fall in the discount rate generally increases the mark to market value of the assets depending on \\nthe duration of asset.\\nSalary risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of members. \\nAs such, an increase in the salary of the members more than assumed level will increase the plan’s liability.\\nInvestment risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined \\nby reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds. If the return on plan asset is below this \\nrate, it will create a plan deficit. Currently, for the plan in India, it has a relatively balanced mix of investments in government \\nsecurities and other debt instruments.\\nAsset liability matching risk: The plan faces the ALM risk as to the matching cash flow. Since the plan is invested in lines of \\nRule 101 of Income Tax Rules, 1962, this generally reduces ALM risk.\\nMortality risk: Since the benefits under the plan is not payable for life time and payable till retirement age only, plan does not \\nhave any longevity risk.\\nConcentration risk: Plan is having a concentration risk as all the assets are invested with the insurance companies\\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n226\\nNotes\\n\\nNotes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\n47   FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\\n Financial risk management objectives and policies\\nThe Group’s financial principal liabilities comprises  lease liability, trade payables and other payables.

The Company \\napplied for the first-time these amendments.\\n (i)  Definition of Accounting Estimates - Amendments to Ind AS 8\\nThe amendments clarify the distinction between changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies and the \\ncorrection of errors. It has also been clarified how entities use measurement techniques and inputs to develop accounting estimates.  \\nThe amendments had no impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.\\n (ii) Disclosure of Accounting Policies - Amendments to Ind AS 1\\nThe amendments aim to help entities provide accounting policy disclosures that are more useful by replacing the requirement \\nfor entities to disclose their ‘significant’ accounting policies with a requirement to disclose their ‘material’ accounting policies \\nand adding guidance on how entities apply the concept of materiality in making decisions about accounting policy disclosures.  \\nThe amendments have had an impact on the Group’s disclosures of accounting policies, but not on the measurement, \\nrecognition or presentation of any items in the Group’s financial statements.\\n (iii) Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction - Amendments to Ind AS 12\\nThe amendments narrow the scope of the initial recognition exception under Ind AS 12, so that it no longer applies to \\ntransactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences such as leases.\\nThe Group previously recognised for deferred tax on leases on a net basis. As a result of these amendments, the Group has \\nrecognised a separate deferred tax asset in relation to its lease liabilities and a deferred tax liability in relation to its right-of-use \\nassets. Since, these balances qualify for offset as per the requirements of paragraph 74 of Ind AS 12,there is no impact in the \\nbalance sheet. There was also no impact on the opening retained earnings as at 1 st April, 2023.\\n51 STANDARDS NOTIFIED BUT NOT EFFECTIVE\\nThere are no standards that are notified and not yet effective as on the date.\\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n230\\nNotes\\n\\nNotes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\n52 SHAREHOLDING OF PROMOTERS     \\n As at 31 st March, 2024\\nPromoter Name No of shares at \\nthe beginning \\nof the year\\nChange during \\nthe year\\nNo of shares at \\nthe end of the \\nyear\\n% of total \\nshares\\n% change \\nduring the year\\n1.
