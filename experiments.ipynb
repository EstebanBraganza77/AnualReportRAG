TECHNOLOGY ABSORPTION, ADAPTATION AND \\nINNOVATIONS\\n 1. Efforts made towards technology absorption, adaptation and \\ninnovation:\\n  a. Joint R&D with Indian and foreign universities and \\nresearch institutes:\\n   Our company has a robust R&D in-house for technology \\nand product excellence. However, towards continued \\nexcellence in the ever-evolving tyre technology, we \\nwork on R&D projects with Institutions of eminence \\nin India and abroad. The projects cover a broad range \\nof comprehensive scientific understanding on the \\n‘interfaces and interphases’ of tyres, materials and \\ndesign aspects on the noise-vibration-harshness (NVH) \\naspects, exploration of novel- and sustainable materials \\n(bio-derived and circular), advancement of simulation \\ncapability, and nano- and nanostructured materials with \\nthe overall stated aim of the company to continuously \\nadvance green and sustainable tyre technologies. \\nThe joint R&D programs resulted in PhD degrees, \\ninternational publications and patents.  \\n  b. New product and material development, elimination of \\nhazardous materials, etc.:\\n   To improve sustainability of products, our company \\nis working on the multipronged 4R strategy of reduce, \\nrecycle, reuse and renewable. Our “Reduce” strategy \\nimplies achieving a reduction in the carbon footprint \\nduring the usage phase through a reduction in the rolling \\nresistance of tyres as well as a carbon footprint reduction \\nby ‘materials’ conservation’ through reduced usage of \\nraw materials (light-weighted tyres). The “Recycle” \\nstrategy involves promoting the usage of recycled \\nmaterials from waste and recovered materials from \\nend-of-life tyres as circular raw materials for new tyres. \\nThe focus of the “Reuse” methodology is on materials \\nand energy conservation through designing multiple \\nretreadable tyres and promoting the retreading process \\nby own networks, and the “Renewable” strategy implies \\nusage of sustainable raw materials from renewable \\nsources such as biomass. \\n   Towards import substitution, we have initiated joint \\ndevelopment programs with domestic suppliers for raw \\nmaterials such as sulphur, accelerators, antioxidants, \\nbutyl rubber, halobutyl rubber, microcrystalline wax, \\nsuper tackifier resin, performance resins, anti-reversion \\nagents, filler coupling / process agents, etc.'),\n",

World \\neconomy moved towards a soft landing with growth holding up and \\ninflation declining. MRF continued its industry leading growth in the \\ndomestic market.\\nEconomic growth was steady during the year despite monetary tightening, \\nwarnings of recession and impact of climate related events. Global trade \\nwas muted with increased geo economic fragmentation, trade restrictions \\nand lower consumption arising from tight financial conditions. Emerging \\neconomies performed better than the developed world. There was \\nsteady reduction in inflation in both developed and emerging economies \\nprompting Central Banks to pause interest rate hikes, though inflation is still \\nabove the target in most economies. Geo political issues continued causing \\ndisturbance to the world with the continuing Ukraine war, tensions in West \\nAsia and disturbances to commercial shipping in the Red Sea.\\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates show that World Economy \\ngrew by 3.2% in calendar year 2023 bettering its own earlier estimates. \\nIMF estimates that growth in 2024 would be similar to 2023. Inflation \\nis expected to decline steadily.Geopolitical disturbances could impact \\ninflation trajectory and delay central Bank policy easing, with adverse \\neffects on global growth. Rate cuts by Central Banks is now expected to \\nbe in the 2nd half of 2024.\\nMarket & Industry Overview\\nGrowth surprised on the upside for Indian economy over the quarters, \\ndriven by investment. Despite a difficult external sector and weakness in \\nagriculture arising from a patchy monsoon, Indian economy performed \\nwell riding on the strength of its domestic demand. Government of India’s \\nadvance estimates of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for 2023-24 shows a \\ngrowth at 7.6%. India continued to remain the fastest growing economy. \\nGrowth was led by manufacturing and construction. \\nPrivate consumption was weak as in the previous year, owing to lower \\nrural demand while urban demand was robust. There are early signs that \\nprivate investment is picking up, responding to growth in the economy. \\nIndia’s merchandise exports declined by 3% while total exports, including \\nservices, was at the same level as the previous year. Geo political issues \\nand weakened consumer demand impacted exports. But trade deficit was \\nlower by more than 9% as imports too contracted. Exports of electronics \\nwere a bright spot. \\nNon-food Inflation fell by 2.5% during the year (April,2023 to \\nJanuary,2024) while food inflation rose by 0.40% in the same period. \\nIndia has managed to deliver on both growth and inflation management.  \\nThe Government struck to the path of fiscal consolidation in the vote on \\naccount that was presented. Continuing with the thrust on capex, capital \\nexpenditure outlay was hiked by 11%. \\nIndian Government securities is set to be included in the emerging markets \\nbond index by Morgan Stanley and other financial institutions, reflecting \\nconfidence in the India growth story and the financial system. This move \\npaves the way for dollar inflows into the country’s sovereign debt market \\nand reduction of borrowing costs in the economy.  \\nIndia Meteorological Department (IMD) has projected an above normal \\nmonsoon for the year which should improve rural growth and consumption. \\nGrowth in financial year 2023-2024 came from Government spending \\nand high end consumption with only a marginal growth in agriculture. \\nA good monsoon should add to the growth of the economy in financial \\nyear 2024-25. Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has projected financial year \\n2024-25 GDP growth at 7% while IMF has projected the same at 6.8%.  \\nGlobal car sales grew by 10% in calendar year 2023 after a flat growth \\nin 2022. Electric car sales grew more than a third. Adoption of Electric \\nVehicles (EV) continued across markets. High vehicle costs and high \\ninterest rates were a pain point for the Industry. \\nIndian automobile industry performed well in financial year 2024 with \\ndomestic sales showing a growth of 12.5% (source: Society of Indian \\nAutomobile Manufacturers (SIAM)). Passenger vehicle segment and two \\nwheeler segment led the growth while commercial vehicles managed \\nto grow only marginally. Tractors were a weak spot as irregular rains \\nimpacted demand. In the passenger segment, share of entry level vehicles \\ncontinued to shrink. Demand revival was seen for entry level two wheelers \\nduring festive season and also in the last quarter of financial year 2023-24.'),\n",

There was sizeable drop in sales in commercial vehicles, \\ntwo wheelers and three wheelers while export of passenger vehicles grew \\nmarginally (source: SIAM). \\nThe production of Medium and Heavy Commercial Vehicle (M&HCV) \\nduring the year has seen a very marginal growth. The bus sales that was \\nimpacted during the Covid period is bouncing back. The trailer segment \\nis also seeing a growth every year fuelled by loading restrictions in many \\nmarkets. Electric vehicles have till now been predominantly in the bus \\nsegment operated by the state transport undertakings. Various regulatory \\nnorms are expected to be implemented during the year 2024-25 and \\nthe Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEMs) have been gearing up for \\nthe same. As a result of this, the tyre performance criteria of OEMs have \\nundergone considerable changes. \\nQuite a few new products were launched by us both in the bias and radial \\nsegment. This has helped us further consolidate our position with both the \\nOEM and in after sales markets.\\nThe current indications are that the first half of 2024-25 would be sluggish \\nand even with an anticipated recovery in the second half, the OEM \\nproduction is expected to continue to be flat if not marginally negative.  \\nThe passenger vehicle production has seen a growth of 7% in the year \\nended March,2024. Domestic  sales also recorded  yet again the highest \\never sale in a financial year. The segment continued to witness preference \\nfor Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs), which has now a share of more \\nthan 50% in overall sales. Despite price increases, better supplies and \\nsustained consumer demand, especially for SUVs, supported sales. The \\nwaiting period for many car models have come down and the stocks have \\nimproved in the dealerships. The shift to electric vehicle has intensified \\nfew years ago and continues this year as well.\\nTwo wheeler production showed growth for the second consecutive \\nyear. Motorcycle and scooter production saw good growth during the \\nyear. However, it is yet to reach the pre-Covid levels. In motorcycles, \\nthe 125 cc and above segment is showing a higher growth in production \\nand currently accounts for more than a third of the total production. A \\nslew of product launches by various OEMs were seen in the segment with \\nhigher cubic capacity (cc).  Growth has been fuelled by domestic sales \\nand exports continues to be sluggish. The year also saw the entry of one of \\nthe prominent OEMs into the 100 cc motorcycle segment.  \\nYour Company continues to be a preferred choice of fitment of OEMs \\nin most of their new launches. Many OEMs increased their fitment of \\nour tyres on their existing models also. During the year, the Company \\nlaunched ‘W’ rated Steel belted motorcycle radial tyres for the high \\nperformance segment, under the brand name ‘Steel Brace’. The Company \\nhas also further strengthened its after market portfolio with new products \\nboth in the motorcycle and scooter segment. \\nDuring the year, the government reduced the subsidies under the FAME 2 \\nscheme for electric vehicles which had a short-term impact on their sales. \\nSubsequently the tenure of the FAME 2 scheme also ended in March,2024. \\nThe new Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme has been announced for the \\nperiod 1st April, 2024 to 30th July, 2024.\\nTractor Production had shown a decline of 11% in the financial year \\n2023-24. A trend was observed among Tractor OEMs of bringing out \\nnewer lower HP and light weight tractor models. Tractor OEMs have \\nstarted planning for electric tractors in the near term. During the year, \\nthe Company was able to improve and consolidate its market share in \\nTractor OEMs. Farm mechanization is growing in India, with increased \\nusage of laser leveller, rotavators, reapers, paddy transplanters and \\nharvesters among farmers. This can lead to significant usage of higher \\nHP tractors in India in the near future. In the replacement segment, your \\nCompany continues to be the most preferred brand in the market place. \\nReplacement sales had shown considerable buoyancy this year. IMD has \\nforecasted an above normal monsoon during the coming season which \\nwould help revive the farming sector in financial year 2024-25. \\nTyre Industry posted a moderate growth in the financial year 2023-24 \\nin comparison to the previous year.

Above average monsoon forecasted \\nshould improve rural demand and will be a tailwind for high growth in the \\neconomy. Inflation is moving towards RBI’s target of 4% even though food \\ninflation is sticky. Possible reduction in interest rates by RBI in the second \\nhalf would further aid growth and capital spend. Private sector capital \\ncapex should get a boost from demand increase and potential interest \\ncost reduction.\\nFood inflation has not shown a meaningful improvement in the last year. \\nExtreme weather events can keep food inflation elevated which may \\ninfluence RBI’s decision on interest rates.

Basis for Opinion\\n We conducted our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements \\nin accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified \\nunder Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those \\nStandards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for \\nthe Audit of the Standalone  Financial Statements section of our \\nreport. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the \\nCode of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of \\nIndia (ICAI) together with the independence requirements that are \\nrelevant to our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements under \\nthe provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have \\nfulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these \\nrequirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the \\naudit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to \\nprovide a basis for our audit opinion on the Standalone Financial \\nStatements.\\n3. Emphasis of Matter\\n We draw attention to Note 28((q(i)(a)) to the Standalone Financial \\nStatement which describe the following matter :\\n In terms of the Order dated 31st August 2018 the Competition \\nCommission of India (CCI) has on 2nd February 2022 released its \\nOrder imposing penalty on the Company concerning the breach of \\nprovisions of the Competition Act, 2002 during the year 2011-2012 \\nand imposed a penalty of ` 622.09 Crores on the Company.  The \\nappeal filed by the Company has been disposed of by the National \\nCompany Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in December 2022, by \\nremanding the matter to CCI for review after hearing the parties.  CCI \\nhas in February 2023 filed an appeal against the Order of NCLAT \\nbefore the Hon’ble Supreme Court. Pending disposal, the Company \\nhas filed an appeal before the Hon’ble Supreme Court against the \\norder of NCLAT, which has been tagged with the appeal filed by CCI \\nin the Supreme Court. The Company is of the view that no provision \\nis considered necessary in respect of this matter in the Standalone \\nFinancial Results.\\n Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\\n4. Key Audit Matters \\n Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional \\njudgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial \\nstatements of the current year. These matters were addressed in \\nthe context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and \\nin forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate \\nopinion on these matters.'),\n",

Due to the size of these schemes, small \\nchanges in these assumptions can have a material \\nimpact on the estimated defined benefit obligation\\nOur audit procedures included: \\nWe have examined the key controls over the process involving member data, formulation \\nof assumptions and the financial reporting process in arriving at the provision for retirement \\nbenefits.  We tested the controls for determining the actuarial assumptions and the approval \\nof those assumptions by senior management. We found these key controls were designed, \\nimplemented and operated effectively, and therefore determined that we could place reliance \\non these key controls for the purposes of our audit.\\nWe tested the employee data used in calculating the obligation and  where material, we also \\nconsidered the treatment of curtailments, settlements, past service costs, remeasurements, \\nbenefits paid, and any other amendments made to obligations during the year. From the evidence \\nobtained, we found the data and assumptions used by management in the actuarial valuations \\nfor retirement benefit obligations to be appropriate.\\n2\\nProvision for Sales related obligations\\nThe Company makes an estimated provision for \\nsales related obligations based on commitments, \\nestablished trade practices, historical trends and \\nother assumptions which are judgemental including \\nthose relating to outflow of resources.\\nConsidering the significant judgements involved in \\nmaking the above estimate, we have considered this \\nas a key audit matter. \\nOur audit procedures included: \\nWe understood and tested the controls over the assumptions applied in arriving at the provision \\nfor Sales related obligations.  \\nTested on sample basis, the provision made during the year with relevant data elements, \\nassumptions involved,  validation of formula used in the spread sheet and  management review \\nand control of the relevant internal and external factors impacting the provision.\\n3 Provision for Extended Producer Responsibility \\n(EPR)\\n(Refer Note 28 j) \\nThe Company has recognised provision towards EPR \\nobligations based on the notification issued by the \\nMinistry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.  \\nThe obligation is to be met by purchasing certificates \\nfrom Recyclers and the provision is estimated based \\non current cost estimate.  \\nGiven the inherent complexity and the magnitude of \\nthe potential exposures and judgements necessary \\nto estimate the amount of provision required and to \\ndetermine required disclosures, we have considered \\nthis as a key audit matter.\\nOur audit procedures included: \\nWe have obtained an understanding on the requirement of the notification and of the process \\nfollowed by the Company for assessment and determination of the amount of provision required \\n/ recognized and the appropriateness of the disclosures made in the financial statements.'),\n",

A \\nCompany’s internal financial control with reference to Standalone \\nFinancial Statements includes those policies and procedures \\nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable \\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions \\nof the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance \\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation \\nof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted \\naccounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the \\nCompany are being made only in accordance with authorisations \\nof management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide \\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of \\nunauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s \\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\n5. INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS \\nWITH REFERENCE TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls \\nwith reference to Standalone Financial Statements, including \\nthe possibility of collusion or improper management override of \\ncontrols, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur \\nand not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the \\ninternal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial \\nStatements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal \\nfinancial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements \\nmay become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that \\nthe degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may \\ndeteriorate.\\nFor M.M.

The estimates and associated assumptions \\nare based on historical experience and other factors that are \\nconsidered to be relevant and are prudent and reasonable.  \\nActual results may differ from those estimates. The estimates \\nand underlying assumptions are reviewed on ongoing basis. \\nRevisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period \\nin which the estimates are revised if the revision affects only \\nthat period or in the period of revision and future periods if the \\nrevision affects both current and future period.\\n  The few critical estimations and judgments made in applying \\naccounting policies are:\\n Property, Plant and Equipment/Intangible Assets:\\n Useful life of Property, Plant and Equipment are as specified in \\nSchedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 and on certain intangible \\nassets based on technical advice which considered the nature of \\nthe asset, the usage of the asset, expected physical wear and tear,'),\n",

The \\nCompany reviews the useful life of Property, Plant and Equipment \\nand intangible assets at the end of each reporting period. This \\nreassessment may result in change in depreciation charge in future \\nperiods (Refer Note 1 (C 1)).\\n Impairment of Non-financial Assets:\\n For calculating the recoverable amount of non-financial assets, the \\nCompany is required to estimate the value-in-use of the asset or the \\nCash Generating Unit and the fair value less costs to disposal. For \\ncalculating value in use the Company is required to estimate the \\ncash flows to be generated from using the asset. The fair value of \\nan asset is estimated using a valuation technique where observable \\nprices are not available. Further, the discount rate used in value in \\nuse calculations includes an estimate of risk assessment specific to \\nthe asset. \\n Impairment of Financial Assets:\\n The Company impairs financial assets other than those measured \\nat fair value through profit or loss or designated at fair value \\nthrough other comprehensive income on expected credit losses. \\nThe estimation of expected credit loss includes the estimation \\nof probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and the \\nexposure at default (EAD). Estimation of probability of default apart \\nfrom involving trend analysis of past delinquency rates includes an \\nestimation on forward-looking information relating to not only the \\ncounterparty but also relating to the industry and the economy as a \\nwhole. The probability of default is estimated for the entire life of the \\ncontract by estimating the cash flows that are likely to be received \\nin default scenario. The lifetime PD is reduced to 12 months PD \\nbased on an assessment of past history of default cases in 12 months. \\nFurther, the loss given default is calculated based on an estimate of \\nthe value of the security recoverable as on the reporting date. The \\nexposure at default is the amount outstanding at the balance sheet \\ndate (Refer Note 1(C 10)).\\n Defined Benefit Plans:\\n The cost of the defined benefit plan and other post-employment \\nbenefits and the present value of such obligations are determined \\nusing actuarial valuations.  An actuarial valuation involves making \\nvarious assumptions that may differ from actual developments in \\nthe future.  These include the determination of the discount rate, \\nfuture salary increases, mortality rates and attrition rate.  Due to \\nthe complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, \\na defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these \\nassumptions.  All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date \\n(Refer Note 28 (f)).\\n Fair Value Measurement of Financial Instruments:\\n When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities \\nrecorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted \\nprices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation \\ntechniques including the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model.  The \\ninputs to these models are taken from observable markets where \\npossible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is \\nrequired in establishing fair values (Refer Note 1 (C10)).\\n Income Taxes:\\n Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision for \\nincome taxes, including amount expected to be paid/recovered for \\nuncertain tax positions (Refer Note 1 (C 9)).\\n In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, \\nmanagement considers whether some portion or all of the deferred \\nincome tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of \\ndeferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future \\ntaxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences \\nbecome deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals \\nof deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income \\nand tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the \\nlevel of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable \\nincome over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are \\ndeductible, management believes that the Company will realize the \\nbenefits of those deductible differences.

If credit \\nrisk has increased significantly, lifetime ECL is provided. For \\nassessing increase in credit risk and impairment loss, the \\nCompany assesses the credit risk characteristics on instrument-\\nby-instrument basis.\\n  Impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognised during the \\nperiod is recognised as expense/income in profit and loss.\\n  Financial Liabilities\\n  The Company’s financial liabilities includes borrowings, \\ntrade payable, lease liabilities, accrued expenses and other \\npayables.\\n  Initial recognition and measurement\\n  All financial liabilities at initial recognition are classified as \\nfinancial liabilities at amortized cost or financial liabilities at \\nfair value through profit or loss, as appropriate. All financial \\nliabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the \\ncase of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly \\nattributable transaction costs.\\n  Financial Liabilities classified as Amortised Cost:\\n  All Financial Liabilities other than derivatives are measured at \\namortised cost. Interest expense that is not capitalised as part \\nof costs of assets is included as Finance costs in Profit or Loss.\\n  Derecognition\\n  A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation \\nunder the liability is discharged / cancelled / expired. When \\nan existing financial liability is replaced by another from the \\nsame lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an \\nexisting liability are substantially modified, such an exchange'),\n",

Financial instruments affected by market risks, primarily include loans & borrowings, investments \\nand foreign currency receivables, payables and borrowings.\\n  a) Interest Rate Risk : \\n   The Company borrows funds in Indian Rupees to meet both the long term and short term funding requirements. The Company due to its  \\nAAA rated status commands one of the cheapest source of funding.  Interest rate is fixed for the tenor of the Long term loans availed by the \\nCompany. Interest on Short term borrowings is subject to floating interest rate and are repriced regularly. The sensitivity analysis detailed \\nbelow have been determined based on the exposure to variable interest rates on the average outstanding amounts due to bankers over a \\nyear. The Company had issued floating interest rate Non convertible debenture linked to 6 month T-Bill rate, to meet the long term funding \\nrequirements. \\n   If the interest rates had been 1% higher / lower and all other variables held constant, the Company’s profit for the year ended 31st March, \\n2024 would have been decreased/increased by ` 8.14 Crores (Previous year - ` 10.66 Crores).\\n  b) Currency Risk : \\n   Foreign currency risks from financial instruments at the end of the reporting period expressed in INR :\\nUnhedged Short Term Exposures : (` Crores)\\n31.03.2024 31.03.2023\\nFinancial Assets/Other assets  193.53  199.27 \\nFinancial Liabilites/ Other Liabilities  324.21  179.76 \\n   The company is mainly exposed to changes in US Dollar.

Due to the significantly increased volatility of certain commodities like \\nNatural Rubber, Synthetic Rubber, Compound Rubber and other Chemicals, the Company enters into purchase contracts on a short to medium \\nTerm and forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into to bring in stability of price fluctuations.\\n  The Company’s investments in Quoted and Unquoted Securities are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values \\nof investment securities. The Company manages the securities price risk through investments in debt funds and diversification by placing limits on \\nindividual and total investments. Reports on Investment Portfolio are reviewed on regular basis and all approvals of investment decisions are done \\nin concurrence with the senior management.  \\n  As at 31st March, 2024,  the investments in debt mutual funds and bonds amounts to ` 3366.16 Crores (Previous year - ` 3071.00 Crores). A 1% \\npoint increase or decrease in the NAV with all other variables held constant would have lead to approximately an additional ` 34 Crores (Previous \\nyear - ` 31 Crores) on either side in the statement of profit and loss.    \\nii) Credit Risk\\n Is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Company. It arises from credit exposure to \\ncustomers, financial instruments viz., Investments in Equity Shares, Bonds, Debt Funds, Fixed Deposits Others and Balances with Banks.\\n The Company’s marketing policies are well structured and all replacement sales are predominantly through dealers and the outstanding are secured by \\ndealer deposits.  As regards sales to O.E., and other institutional sales, the Company carries out periodic credit checks and also limits the exposure by \\nestablishing maximum payment period for customers and by offering prompt payment discounts. The outstanding trade receivables due for a period \\nexceeding 180 days as at the year ended 31st March, 2024 is 0.02% (31st March, 2023 0.02%) of the total trade receivables. \\n There are no transactions with single customer which amounts to 10% or more of the Company’s revenue. \\n The company uses Expected Credit Loss (ECL) Model to assess the impairment loss or gain.

Opinion\\n We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Financial \\nStatements of MRF Limited (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Holding \\nCompany”) and its subsidiaries (Holding Company and its \\nsubsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”) which comprise \\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2024, and \\nthe Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other \\nComprehensive Income),  the Consolidated Statement of Changes \\nin Equity and the Consolidated Cash Flows Statement for the year \\nended on that date and notes to financial statements, a summary \\nof material accounting policies and other explanatory information \\n(hereinafter referred to as “the Consolidated Financial Statements”).\\n In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to \\nthe explanations given to us, the aforesaid Consolidated Financial \\nStatements give the information required by the Companies Act, \\n2013 (“the Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and \\nfair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind \\nAS) prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with Companies \\n(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended and \\nother accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the \\nConsolidated state of affairs (financial position) of the Group as at \\n31st March, 2024, and its Consolidated profit (financial performance \\nincluding Other Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated Changes \\nin Equity and its Consolidated Cash Flows for the year ended on that \\ndate.\\n2. Basis for Opinion\\n We conducted our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements \\nin accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified \\nunder Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those \\nStandards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for \\nthe Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our \\nreport. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the \\nCode of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of \\nIndia (ICAI) together with the independence requirements that are \\nrelevant to our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements under \\nthe provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have \\nfulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these \\nrequirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the \\naudit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to \\nprovide a basis for our audit opinion on the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements.\\n3. Emphasis of Matter\\n We draw attention to Note 25 (j) (a) to the Consolidated Financial \\nStatement which describe the following matter:\\n In terms of the Order dated 31st August 2018 the Competition \\nCommission of India (CCI) has on 2nd February 2022 released its Order \\nimposing penalty on the Holding Company concerning the breach of \\nprovisions of the Competition Act, 2002 during the year 2011-2012 \\nand imposed a penalty of ` 622.09 Crores on the Holding Company.  \\nThe appeal filed by the Holding Company has been disposed of by \\nthe National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in December \\n2022, by remanding the matter to CCI for review after hearing the \\nparties.  CCI has in February 2023 filed an appeal against the Order \\nof NCLAT before the Hon’ble Supreme Court. Pending disposal, the \\nHolding Company has filed an appeal before the Hon’ble Supreme \\nCourt against the order of NCLAT, which has been tagged with the \\nappeal filed by CCI in the Supreme Court. The Holding Company is \\nof the view that no provision is considered necessary in respect of this \\nmatter in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\\n4. Key Audit Matters \\n Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, \\nwere of most significance in our audit of the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the \\ncontext of our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements as a \\nwhole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide \\na separate opinion on these matters.'),\n",

Due to the size of these schemes, \\nsmall changes in these assumptions can have a \\nmaterial impact on the estimated defined benefit \\nobligation.\\nOur audit procedures included: \\nWe have examined the key controls over the process involving member data, formulation of \\nassumptions and the financial reporting process in arriving at the provision for retirement benefits.  \\nWe tested the controls for determining the actuarial assumptions and the approval of those \\nassumptions by senior management. We found these key controls were designed, implemented \\nand operated effectively, and therefore determined that we could place reliance on these key \\ncontrols for the purposes of our audit.\\nWe tested the employee data used in calculating the obligation and  where material, we also \\nconsidered the treatment of curtailments, settlements, past service costs, remeasurements, \\nbenefits paid, and any other amendments made to obligations during the year. From the evidence \\nobtained, we found the data and assumptions used by management in the actuarial valuations for \\nretirement benefit obligations to be appropriate.\\n2 Provision for Sales related obligations\\nThe Holding Company makes an estimated provision \\nfor sales related obligations based on commitments, \\nestablished trade practices, historical trends and \\nother assumptions which are judgemental including \\nthose relating to outflow of resources.\\nConsidering the significant judgements involved in \\nmaking the above estimate, we have considered this \\nas a key audit matter. \\nOur audit procedures included: \\nWe understood and tested the controls over the assumptions applied in arriving at the provision \\nfor Sales related obligations.  \\nTested on sample basis, the provision made during the year with relevant data elements, \\nassumptions involved,  validation of formula used in the spread sheet and  management review \\nand control of the relevant internal and external factors impacting the provision.\\n3 Provision for Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) \\n(Refer Note 25 k) \\nThe Holding Company has recognised provision \\ntowards EPR obligations based on the notification \\nissued by the Ministry of Environment, Forest \\nand Climate Change.  The obligation is to be met \\nby purchasing certificates from Recyclers and \\nthe provision is estimated based on current cost \\nestimate.  \\nGiven the inherent complexity and the magnitude of \\nthe potential exposures and judgements necessary \\nto estimate the amount of provision required and to \\ndetermine required disclosures, we have considered \\nthis as a key audit matter.\\nOur audit procedures included: \\nWe have obtained an understanding on the requirement of the notification and of the process \\nfollowed by the Holding Company for assessment and determination of the amount of provision \\nrequired / recognized and the appropriateness of the disclosures made in the Consolidated \\nfinancial statements.'),\n",

A \\ncompany’s internal financial control with reference to Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements includes those policies and procedures \\nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable \\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions \\nof the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance \\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation \\nof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted \\naccounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the \\ncompany are being made only in accordance with authorisations \\nof management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide \\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of \\nunauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s \\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\n4. INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS \\nWITH REFERENCE TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial control \\nwith reference to Consolidated Financial Statements including \\nthe possibility of collusion or improper management override of \\ncontrols, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur \\nand not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the \\ninternal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial \\nStatements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal \\nfinancial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements \\nmay become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that \\nthe degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may \\ndeteriorate.\\n5.

Control is achieved when the Holding Company is \\nexposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement \\nwith the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through \\nits power over the investee. Specifically, the Holding Company \\ncontrols an investee if and only if the Holding Company has:\\n\\t •\\t Power\\t over\\tthe\\tinvestee\\t(i.e.\\texisting\\trights\\tthat\\tgive\\tit\\tthe\\t\\ncurrent ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee),\\n\\t •\\t Exposure,\\t or\\trights,\\tto\\tvariable\\treturns\\tfrom\\tits\\tinvolvement\\t\\nwith the investee, and\\n\\t •\\t The\\t ability\\tto\\tuse\\tits\\tpower\\tover\\tthe\\tinvestee\\tto\\taffect\\tits\\t\\nreturns.\\n Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights \\nresult in control. To support this presumption and when the Holding \\nCompany has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of \\nan investee, the Holding Company considers all relevant facts and \\ncircumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, \\nincluding:\\n\\t •\\t The\\t contractual\\tarrangement\\twith\\tthe\\tother\\tvote\\tholders\\tof\\tthe\\t\\ninvestee.\\n\\t •\\t Rights\\tarising\\tfrom\\tother\\tcontractual\\tarrangements.\\n\\t •\\t The\\t Holding\\tCompany’s\\tvoting\\trights\\tand\\tpotential\\tvoting\\t\\nrights.\\n\\t •\\t The\\t size\\tof\\tthe\\tHolding\\tCompany’s\\tholding\\tof\\tvoting\\trights\\t\\nrelative to the size and dispersion of the holdings of the other \\nvoting rights holders.\\n The Holding Company re-assesses whether or not it controls an \\ninvestee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes \\nto one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of \\na Subsidiary begins when the Holding Company obtains control \\nover the Subsidiary and ceases when the Holding Company loses \\ncontrol of the Subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of \\na Subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included \\nin the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date the Holding \\nCompany gains control until the date the Holding Company ceases \\nto control the Subsidiary.\\n Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared using uniform \\naccounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar \\ncircumstances.

Major Sources of Estimation Uncertainty \\n  In the application of accounting policy which are described in \\npara (D) below, the management is required to make judgment, \\nestimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets \\nand liabilities, income and expenses, contingent liabilities and \\nthe accompanying disclosures that are not readily apparent \\nfrom other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions \\nare based on historical experience and other factors that are \\nconsidered to be relevant and are prudent and reasonable.  \\nActual results may differ from those estimates. The estimates \\nand underlying assumptions are reviewed on ongoing basis. \\nRevisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period \\nin which the estimates are revised if the revision affects only \\nthat period or in the period of revision and future periods if the \\nrevision affects both current and future period.\\n  The few critical estimations and judgments made in applying \\naccounting policies are:\\n  Property, Plant and Equipment/Intangible Assets:\\n  Useful life of Property, Plant and Equipment are as specified \\nin Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 and on certain \\nintangible assets based on technical advice which considered \\nthe nature of the asset, the usage of the asset, expected \\nphysical wear and tear, the operating conditions of the asset, \\nanticipated technological changes, manufacturers warranties \\nand maintenance support. The Group reviews the useful life \\nof Property, Plant and Equipment at the end of each reporting \\nperiod. This reassessment may result in change in depreciation \\ncharge in future periods. (Refer Note 1 (D 1))\\n  Impairment of Non-financial Assets:\\n  For calculating the recoverable amount of non-financial assets, \\nthe Group is required to estimate the value-in-use of the asset \\nor the Cash Generating Unit and the fair value less costs to \\ndisposal. For calculating value in use the Group is required \\nto estimate the cash flows to be generated from using the \\nasset. The fair value of an asset is estimated using a valuation \\ntechnique where observable prices are not available. Further, \\nthe discount rate used in value in use calculations includes an \\nestimate of risk assessment specific to the asset. \\n  Impairment of Financial Assets:\\n  The Group impairs financial assets other than those measured \\nat fair value through profit or loss or designated at fair value \\nthrough other comprehensive income on expected credit \\nlosses. The estimation of expected credit loss includes the \\nestimation of probability of default (PD), loss given default \\n(LGD) and the exposure at default (EAD). Estimation of \\nprobability of default apart from involving trend analysis of \\npast delinquency rates include an estimation on forward-\\nlooking information relating to not only the counterparty but \\nalso relating to the industry and the economy as a whole. \\nThe probability of default is estimated for the entire life of \\nthe contract by estimating the cash flows that are likely to \\nbe received in default scenario. The lifetime PD is reduced \\nto 12 months PD based on an assessment of past history of'),\n",

Further, the loss given default is \\ncalculated based on an estimate of the value of the security \\nrecoverable as on the reporting date. The exposure at default \\nis the amount outstanding at the balance sheet date. (Refer \\nNote 1 (D 10))\\n  Defined Benefit Plans:\\n  The cost of the defined benefit plan and other post-\\nemployment benefits and the present value of such obligations \\nare determined using actuarial valuations.  An actuarial \\nvaluation involves making various assumptions that may differ \\nfrom actual developments in the future.  These include the \\ndetermination of the discount rate, future salary increases, \\nmortality rates and attrition rate.  Due to the complexities \\ninvolved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined \\nbenefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these \\nassumptions.  All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting \\ndate.\\n  Fair Value Measurement of Financial Instruments:\\n  When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities \\nrecorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on \\nquoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured \\nusing valuation techniques including the Discounted Cash \\nFlow (DCF) model.  The inputs to these models are taken \\nfrom observable markets where possible, but where this is \\nnot feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing \\nfair values. Judgments include considerations of inputs \\nsuch as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility.  Changes in \\nassumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair \\nvalue of financial instruments. (Refer Note 1 (D 10))\\n  Income Taxes\\n  Significant judgments are involved in determining the \\nprovision for income taxes, including amount expected to be \\npaid/recovered for uncertain tax positions. (Refer Note 1 (D 9))\\n  In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, \\nmanagement considers whether some portion or all of the \\ndeferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate \\nrealization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon \\nthe generation of future taxable income during the periods \\nin which the temporary differences become deductible. \\nManagement considers the scheduled reversals of deferred \\nincome tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax \\nplanning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the \\nlevel of historical taxable income and projections for future \\ntaxable income over the periods in which the deferred income \\ntax assets are deductible, management believes that the \\ngroup will realize the benefits of those deductible differences. \\nThe amount of the deferred income tax assets considered \\nrealizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if \\nestimates of future taxable income during the carry forward \\nperiod are reduced.\\n  Leases\\n  Ind AS 116 requires lessees to determine the lease term as the \\nnon-cancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option \\nto extend or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is \\nreasonably certain. The Group makes an assessment on the \\nexpected lease term on a lease-by-lease basis and thereby \\nassesses whether it is reasonably certain that any options \\nto extend or terminate the contract will be exercised. In \\nevaluating the lease term, the Group considers factors such as \\nany significant leasehold improvements undertaken over the \\nlease term, costs relating to the termination of the lease and \\nthe importance of the underlying asset to Group’s operations \\ntaking into account the location of the underlying asset and \\nthe availability of suitable alternatives. The lease term in future \\nperiods is reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the \\ncurrent economic circumstances.  After considering current \\nand future economic conditions, the Group concludes that no \\nchanges are required to lease period relating to the existing \\nlease contracts.

Capital Management\\n For the purpose of Group’s Capital Management, capital includes Issued Equity Capital, Securities Premium, and all other Equity Reserves attributable to \\nthe Equity Holders of the Group. The primary objective of the Group’s Capital Management is to maximise the Share Holder Value.\\n The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in the light of changes in economic conditions and requirements of the financial \\ncovenants and to continue as a going concern. The Group monitors using a gearing ratio which is net debts divided by total capital plus net debt. The \\nGroup includes within net debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings, less cash and short term deposit.\\nB. Financial Risk Management\\n The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, lease liability, trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial \\nliabilities is to finance the operations of the Group. The principal financial assets include trade and other receivables, investments in mutual funds, Bonds, \\ncash and short term deposits.\\n The Group has assessed market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk to its financial instruments.\\n i) Market Risk\\n  Is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a financial instrument, as a result of interest \\nrates, foreign exchange rates and other price risks. Financial instruments affected by market risks, primarily include loans & borrowings, investments \\nand foreign currency receivables, payables and borrowings.\\n  a) Interest Rate Risk:\\n   The Group borrows funds in Indian Rupees and Foreign currency, to meet both the long term and short term funding requirements. The \\nInterest rate risk in terms of Foreign currency is managed through financial instruments available to convert floating rate liability into fixed \\nrate liability. The Group due to its  AAA rated status commands one of the cheapest source of funding. Interest rate is fixed for the tenor of \\nthe Long term loans availed by the Group. Interest on Short term borrowings is subject to floating interest rate and are repriced regularly. The \\nsensitivity analysis detailed below have been determined based on the exposure to variable interest rates on the average outstanding amounts \\ndue to bankers over a year. The Group had issued floating interest rate Non-convertible debentures linked to 6 month T-Bill rate, to meet long \\nterm funding requirements.\\n   If the interest rates had been 1% higher / lower and all other variables held constant, the Group’s profit for the year ended 31st March, 2024 \\nwould have been decreased/increased by ` 14.25  Crores (Previous year ` 16.56 Crores).'),\n",

The Group manages the securities price risk through investments in debt funds and diversification by placing limits \\non individual and total investments.

A \\n1% point increase or decrease in the NAV with all other variables held constant would have lead to approximately an additional ` 34 Crores \\n(Previous year - ` 31 Crores) on either side in the statement of profit and loss.\\nii) Credit Risk\\n Is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Company. It arises from credit exposure to \\ncustomers, financial instruments viz., Investments in Equity Shares, Bonds, Debt Funds, Fixed Deposits others and Balances with Banks.\\n The Group’s marketing policies are well structured and all replacement sales are predominantly through dealers and the outstanding are secured by \\ndealer deposits.  As regards sales to O.E., and other institutional sales, the Group carries out periodic credit checks and also limits the exposure by \\nestablishing maximum payment period for customers and by offering prompt payment discounts.  The outstanding trade receivables due for a period \\nexceeding 180 days as at the year ended 31st March, 2024 is 0.02% (31st March, 2023 - 0.02%) of the total trade receivables.'),\n",

He was anxious to start a \\nbusiness beyond investing, which would \\nenable him to test his hypothesis about \\nthe Indian consumer. After a couple of \\nyears of introspection and research,  \\nhe decided to start a grocery retail chain, \\nfocusing primarily on the value segment. \\nDMart, our retail chain, was conceived \\nby him in the year 2000. Mr. Damani \\nimagined the retail business with the \\nsame values of simplicity, speed, and \\nnimbleness that he espoused in his \\nstellar investing career. \\nAbout DMart | Core Values, Vision and Mission\\nA focus on financial fundamentals, \\nhigh\\xa0levels of patience and strong \\nconviction have been the bedrock \\non which the Company’s values and \\nbusiness direction have been built. \\nDMart took eight years to start its first \\nten stores. This wasn’t because of dearth \\nof investment opportunities, but more \\nbecause of his belief in the importance \\nof validating the business model from \\na perspective of both profitability and \\nscalability. His beginnings at DMart \\nwere frugal. For a number of years since \\ninception, DMart’s corporate operations \\nwere run from a small space carved out \\nfrom one of the early stores. He and his \\nearly leadership team worked together \\nas one cohesive unit without any \\nhierarchy or barriers.  \\nDMart was conceived by value investor Mr. Radhakishan \\nDamani in the year 2000, who at the time was operating \\na single store in Maharashtra. With a mission to be the \\nlowest-priced retailer in its area of operation, DMart has \\ngrown steadily over the years, and operates 365 stores in \\n10 States, 1 Union Territory and NCR. The Company has \\ndelivered stable performance across stakeholder metrics \\nby focusing on financial fundamentals, with fortitude and \\nstrong conviction.\\nMore importantly, from the very \\nbeginning, he had the foresight to \\nunderstand and strongly believed that \\nany business needs the right blend of \\nentrepreneurship and professionalism. \\nEntrepreneurship to build and strengthen \\nthe concept in its formative years, and \\nprofessionalism to allow a committed \\nteam to create, sustain and grow a \\nscalable business model into the future. \\nToday, DMart continues to focus on this \\nearly belief system created during our \\nformative years. We have a good blend \\nof entrepreneurial spirit and high-quality \\nexecution. We humbly attribute our \\nsuccess to the values and the way of \\nbusiness thinking that our founder has \\ninstilled in us.'),\n",

Considering the overall development of \\nthe country, the emission per person and the nature of our business model, we have \\ndeveloped a matrix for our go-to-market strategy on sustainability. It is an approach \\nthat is practical and appropriate. It is not aggressive or path breaking, however it is \\ncontextual to deliver incremental results over a long period of time.\\nEnvironmental Focus at DMart\\n\\nAvenue Supermarts Limited | ANNUAL REPORT FY 2023-24\\n13\\nReproduced from Annual Report 2021-22 (Green Building Certification Number updated for the current year.)\\nOur fundamental business model thrives \\non the principle of doing more with less. \\nValue retail is more supply chain than \\nretail. Our ability to deliver good quality \\nproducts in the most efficient manner \\nand in a conducive environment to \\nour end consumer is the bedrock on \\nwhich the business model was created \\nand further strengthened. We like bulk \\nat every step of the process – bulk \\nin procurement, bulk in movement of \\ngoods and bulk in buying behaviour \\nof our shoppers. It is our endeavour to \\nmake customers come to our store less \\noften but buy significantly more than \\nthey would buy at any other retail store. \\nThis approach helps us create capacity \\nto serve more customers per day. \\nA\\xa0customer buying a very large quantity \\nof goods once or twice a month is also \\nsignificantly better for the climate than \\n10 quick deliveries a week of small value \\nitems at the doorstep.\\nBoth types of need exist and hence \\nmultiple formats of retail evolve. \\nHowever, we like to play in the bulk \\nbuying need sector. This invariably \\nneeds a lot of hard work from our \\nemployees and partners, precision \\nsystems and a competent workforce. \\nHence our focus on recruiting locals in \\nevery location and then upskilling them \\nand grooming them to become leaders \\nof tomorrow is very intrinsic to our model \\nof efficient operation and long-term \\ncompetitive advantage. Our endeavour \\nis also to nurture local products and \\nlocal businesses so that they too can \\ncompete with minimal costs to launch \\ntheir products. At the same time, we \\nhave active conversations with our large \\nand organised suppliers on how they \\ncould create a positive impact to climate \\nchange through innovation. We have just \\nbegun this journey and we hope to make \\ngood progress over time.\\nOur purpose to deliver good products \\nalso means we make significant \\nattempts to enhance the quality of \\nproducts such that they have durability \\nand long-lasting capability while also \\ndelivering great value to the shopper. \\nOur view on quality is that it is relative \\nto the evolution of the customer in that \\nstate or city. It is our constant attempt to \\nnudge the customer to choose wisely, \\nsuch that in the long-term they get great \\nvalue by choosing good-quality products.\\nOur commitment to making \\nimprovements towards the environmental \\nsituation is reflected in increasingly \\ngetting our locations certified under \\nGreen Building movement in India - \\n217\\xa0buildings of the Company have \\nachieved Green Building Certifications \\n(GBC) (38 buildings with Gold \\ncertification under US GBC LEED, 1 \\nbuilding with Gold Certification under \\nIndian GBC LEED, and 178 buildings \\nwith Gold Certification under Indian \\nGBC). That apart, our footprint decisions \\nconsider optimal use of resources and \\nit is our earnest attempt to minimise \\nadverse environmental impact.\\nWe have integrated consolidation of \\nbuying and transporting merchandise \\nthrough our large distribution centers into \\nour model as opposed to being delivered \\nin small lots to our various stores by \\nvendors, increasing deployment of \\nvehicles using greener fuel; continually \\nincreasing use of solar energy; \\nfreshwater conservation practices viz. \\nuse of sewage treatment plants, waste-\\nwater recycling, rainwater harvesting, \\nUse of spray washers etc; responsible \\ndisposal of plastic waste and electronic \\nwaste; responsibly sourced papers (FSC \\ncertified papers & boards), choice of \\nsustainable building materials as few \\nmajor initiatives that help us conserve \\nkey resources. We also have a very large \\ninstallation of an IOT ecosystem that \\nmonitors many of our energy consuming \\nequipment and recommends basis \\nalerts on early warnings of possible \\nbreakdowns and energy conservation \\npossibilities.\\nOur first few steps on Sustainability \\nhave been to identify a few key ideas \\nand go ahead and implement them. \\nWe are now in the process of building \\nsystems to measure, monitor and then \\ndefine and design the direction on other \\naspects of sustainability. Our belief is \\nthat Sustainability has to be intrinsic to \\nour business model. Unless there is an \\neconomic model to Sustainability, it won’t \\nlast too long. The Sustainability Matrix \\nthat we have defined for ourselves is \\nthe culmination of that deliberation \\nand crystalisation of the direction we \\nwant to take to achieve our goals. In \\norder to achieve these targets, we have \\nestablished management systems \\nwhich entail regular monitoring of KPIs, \\ndevelopment of an environmental \\nmanagement plan and reviewing \\nprogress on a regular basis.\\nWe have a Sustainability Officer who \\nis responsible for periodic review of \\nmaterial issues, scanning the external \\nenvironment for evolving sustainability \\ntrends and regulations, monitoring the \\nprogress on sustainability targets and \\nfacilitating in implementing sustainability \\ninitiatives. It is our firm belief that a far \\nmore sustainable world for the future \\nwill be led by a congruence of efforts \\n– regulatory, economic, best-in-class \\npractices by our Company, our suppliers \\nand most importantly by our shoppers \\nthrough the choices they make while \\nshopping with us.\\n\\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW \\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n14\\nThe above matrix indicates some of our efforts within each dimension.

Energy Efficiency\\na)  Solar Energy: We have \\ncommissioned 36 solar plants in \\nFY\\xa02023-24 with a capacity of \\n8.2 MW. We now have a total of \\n226 solar plants with cumulative \\ncapacity of 36.0 MW from these \\ninstallations. Of the total energy \\nrequirement at these 226 premises, \\n24.1% (PY: 21 .8%) is met through \\nSolar Energy. Subject to on-ground \\nfeasibility, it is our endeavour to \\nensure that all our new premises \\nhave a solar plant installed. We \\ncontinued installing rooftop solar \\nplants at some of our distribution \\nand production centers. Further, \\nwe have installed car ports at 36 \\nstores during the year.

We \\ncontinued using energy efficient \\ninverter air conditioners at select \\nlocations.\\n\\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW \\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n16\\nWater Conservation\\na)  Sewage Treatment Plants \\n(STPs): We recognise water as \\na valuable and scarce resource, \\nand thus, we are actively working \\ntowards minimising our reliance on \\nfreshwater. Across our premises, \\nwe have established 180 Sewage \\nTreatment Plants (STPs) with a \\ncombined capacity of treating \\n1,885 kiloliters of water per day. \\n36% of our total water usage at \\nthese premises is met through \\nrecycled water. As a result, we \\nhave successfully reduced our \\nfreshwater usage by an estimated \\n154,895 kiloliters across these 180 \\npremises.\\nb)  Pressure Washers: We have \\nstarted using Pressure Washers \\nat our premises. Water is released \\nwith pressure from the nozzles \\nof this equipment which helps in \\nefficient cleaning at significantly \\nlower water consumption. Further, \\nthe equipment also has an \\nintegrated auto-stop system which \\nenhances energy efficiency.\\nc)  Rainwater Harvesting: We have \\nrainwater harvesting system across \\nlocations comprising of 386 pits/tanks \\nwith a designed cumulative capacity \\nof 9,694 cubic metres per day.\\nd)  Water Efficient Fixtures: We have \\ninstalled low-flow water efficient \\nfixtures at our stores. These have \\naerators fixed by default to maintain \\nand regulate water flow.\\n2.  Sustainable Building Material\\na)  Usage of AAC Blocks: We \\nencourage the usage of Autoclaved \\nAerated Concrete (AAC) Blocks, \\nwhich contain up to 65% of recycled \\nmaterial, for construction of our \\nstores. These blocks use fly-ash \\n– a large pollutant by-product of \\nthermal power plants.\\nb)  Ready Mix Concrete (RMC): We \\nalways strive to procure RMC from \\na location which is close to our \\nsite, thus significantly reducing \\nits transportation. In addition, we \\nalways encourage usage of fly-ash \\n(within permitted limits) in our \\nRMC which is used in our building \\nconstruction.\\nc)  Manufactured Sand: We use \\nManufactured Sand in several \\nlocations for the construction of our \\nbuildings. This significantly reduces \\nour dependence on River Sand.\\nd)  Eco-Friendly Speed Breakers: To \\nmaintain safe vehicular movement \\nwithin our premises we install speed \\nbreakers at strategic points. We \\nhave installed speed breakers made \\nup of composite material which has \\na combination of recycled plastic, \\nconcrete waste, and rubber waste. \\nFor the year FY 2023-24, we have \\ninstalled 6,631 metres of recycled \\nspeed breakers at 92 locations \\nin place of the conventional PVC \\nspeed breakers. This consists of \\n96% of the total speed breakers \\ninstalled at our premises last year.\\nEnvironmental Focus at DMart\\nB.   Recycling / Reuse / Sustainable \\nProducts\\na)  Packaging Waste: At all our stores, \\npaper and plastic packaging waste \\nthat gets generated is segregated \\nand sustainably managed through \\nauthorised recyclers.

Offering free \\ncoaching levels the playing field, ensuring that students from all \\nsocio-economic backgrounds have an equal chance to pursue \\nhigher education and professional success. Education is also \\none of the most effective tools for breaking the cycle of poverty. \\nBy empowering students from low-income backgrounds with \\nthe skills and knowledge needed to succeed academically, they \\nare better equipped to secure high-paying jobs and improve \\ntheir socio-economic status. Many bright and talented students \\nfrom low-income families do not have access to the resources or \\nguidance to excel in competitive exams like JEE/NEET. Such a \\nprogramme allows the society to tap into this pool of meritorious \\nstudents.\\nDMart has been extending support to Dakshana India Education \\nTrust (henceforth, Dakshana) since 2021-22. Dakshana is a \\nphilanthropic foundation with a mission centred around the \\nidea that education is the most powerful and enduring weapon \\nto win the battle against poverty. Dakshana helps bright and \\nimpoverished students, predominantly from rural India, to prepare \\nfor engineering and medical entrance(competitive) exams. \\nDakshana has been offering free coaching scholarships to less \\nadvantaged students from government schools to prepare for \\ncompetitive exams such as JEE/ NEET/ AIIMS for over 17 years \\nwith great success. This project is in alignment with DMart vision \\nof supporting the education of underprivileged children. This \\ninitiative promotes social cohesion and inclusivity. An amount of \\n` 2.5 crore was disbursed for contribution towards scholarship \\nfor students’ coaching, access to educational resources and \\nresidential accommodation. The intervention addresses SDG 4 of \\nthe UN SDGs, Agenda 2030. Nationally, it targets activity (ii) of \\nSchedule VII of the Companies Act, 2013.\\nAs part of the impact assessment, a qualitative approach was \\ndeployed to evaluate project progress and analyse areas of \\nimpact emerging out of the interactions with the key stakeholders. \\nA \\xa0sample size of 86 was covered that involved conducting surveys \\nwith the students and their parents and key informant interviews \\n(KIIs) with the Dakshana team and the DMart team as part of the \\nassessment.\\nUnder the project, scholarships are provided to the selected \\nstudents appearing for JEE/NEET exams. The programme has \\nbeen delivered through residential coaching at the Dakshana \\nValley for an academic year. Through the programme, students \\nwere provided with free residential coaching for preparation of \\nJEE and NEET entrance exams; along with access to educational \\nresources. 200 students were sponsored by DMart as part of this \\ninitiative in 2022-23. 82% of the sponsored students qualified \\nfor IIT and 83% of the sponsored students qualified for various \\ngovernment medical colleges in the previous year with the support \\nof Dakshana.\\nNo major challenges related to project execution were reported or \\nobserved. Few challenges reported were lack of practical-based \\nlearning in the course and low adoption of digital resources. The \\nenrolment of girl students, especially for the engineering (JEE) \\ncourse is low owing to societal norms and cultural restrictions \\non female mobility. Recommendations for adopting teaching \\nmethods with a higher focus on practical learning, integrating \\ndigital resources in the course curriculum and ensuring teachers \\ndo not leave mid-session have been given.\\nNavneet 21 Question Paper Set\\nAccess to educational resources is often limited for students \\nfrom low-income families, contributing to educational disparities. \\nProviding question paper sets to government school students for \\ntheir SSC board examinations not only reduces such disparities \\nbut also ensures that all students have access to the tools they \\nneed to succeed academically.

However, in its efforts to conserve energy, adequate \\nmeasures have been taken in the new and the pre-existing stores. Some of these initiatives are:\\n •   Green Building Certification: We strive to obtain Green Building Certification for our stores under \\nIndian Green Building Council (IGBC) or US Green Building Council (USGBC). A significant effort has been \\nmade throughout a building’s life-cycle from the time of construction to demolition which ensures minimal \\nenvironmental impact. We continued to increase Green Building Certifications for our stores. We have \\nobtained 217 certifications thus far (38 buildings with Gold certification under US GBC LEED, 1 building with \\nGold Certification under Indian GBC LEED, and 178 buildings with Gold Certification under Indian GBC).\\n •   Energy efficient air-conditioning: We use BEE Star rated split air conditioners, which consume less \\nenergy in comparison to conventional air conditioners  We continued using energy efficient inverter air \\nconditioners at select locations.\\n •  Eco-Friendly Speed Breakers: To maintain safe vehicular movement within our premises we install speed \\nbreakers at strategic points. We have installed the speed breakers made up of composite material which \\nhas a combination of recycled plastic, concrete waste and rubber waste. For the year FY 2023-24, we have \\ninstalled 6,631 meters of recycled speed breakers instead of the conventional PVC speed breakers This \\ncumulatively consists of 96% of the total speed breakers installed at our premises last year.\\n•   Hydraulic Baling Press Machines:  We have installed hydraulic baling machines at 255 locations for \\nplastic compaction. These baling machines present multiple benefits like no loose plastic littering, good \\nhygiene and reduced transportation frequency. This initiative helps in reducing the Scope 3 emissions.\\n•   Energy Monitoring Systems (IOT): Our stores are equipped with IOT Ecosystem that helps in monitoring \\nseveral of our energy consuming equipment and recommends basis alerts on early warnings of possible \\nbreakdowns and energy conservation possibilities.\\n•   Natural Gas Generators: Some of our stores have been equipped with Natural Gas Generators  They \\nproduce no particulate matter, relatively lesser emissions and lower noise pollution vis-a-vis diesel generators \\n •   CPCB-IV Compliant Diesel Generator Sets: We have commenced installation of CPCB-IV compliant \\nDiesel Generator Sets at some of our stores. These produce relatively lesser emissions vis-a-vis the previous \\ngeneration of DG’s.\\n•   Retrofit Emissions Control Device (RECD): We continued installation of RECD and Dual Fuel kit for some \\nof our legacy diesel generators at select locations. These devices can capture Particulate Matter Carbon from \\npolluting the air with more than 70% efficiency.\\nFor details please refer ‘Environmental Focus at Dmart’ at page no. 12 of the Annual Report.\\nSteps taken by the \\nCompany for utilising \\nalternate sources of \\nenergy\\nWe have commissioned 36 solar plants in FY 2023-24 with a capacity of 8.2 MW.

However, one of our subsidiary \\nCompany procures, processes and repacks certain products which are provided to end consumers through our stores. Owing \\nto the nature of our business we generate very limited amount of waste. The plastic packaging and paper waste generated at \\nour stores/packaging units is segregated at source and stored in a secured place. This waste is then handed over to authorised \\nrecyclers. We have installed hydraulic baling machines at 255 locations for plastic waste compaction. These baling machines \\npresent multiple benefits like no loose plastic littering, good hygiene and also the reduced transportation frequency.

Reasonable assurance \\nis a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit \\nconducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material \\nmisstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from \\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n116 Independent Auditors’ Report\\n\\nfraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in \\nthe aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence \\nthe economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these \\nstandalone financial statements.\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise \\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism \\nthroughout the audit. We also:\\n• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of \\nthe standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud \\nor error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to \\nthose risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and \\nappropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of \\nnot detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is \\nhigher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve \\ncollusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, \\nor the override of internal control.\\n• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the \\naudit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate \\nin the circumstances.

Changes in the \\nexpected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption \\nof future economic benefits embodied in the asset are \\nconsidered to modify the amortisation period or method, \\nas appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting \\nestimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets \\nwith finite lives is recognised in the statement of profit and \\nloss unless such expenditure forms part of carrying value \\nof another asset.\\nGains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible \\nasset are measured as the difference between the net \\ndisposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and \\nare recognised in the statement of profit or loss when the \\nasset is derecognised.\\n Amortisation of intangible assets\\nAmortisation is provided on straight line method over the \\nuseful life of asset as assessed by the management and the \\nsame is similar to the useful lives as prescribed in Part-C \\nof Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013. Amortisation is \\ncharged on pro-rata basis for asset purchased / sold during \\nthe year. The residual value, useful life and method of \\namortisation of intangible assets are reviewed and adjusted \\nif appropriate at the end of each reporting period.\\nEstimated useful life of assets are as follows:\\nComputer Software - 5 years\\nTrademarks - 5 - 10 years\\n(e) Investment properties\\nInvestments in property that are not intended to be \\noccupied substantially for use by, or in the operations of \\nthe Company, have been classified as investment property. \\nInvestment properties are measured initially at its cost \\nincluding transaction cost and where applicable borrowing \\ncosts. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment \\nproperties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation \\nand accumulated impairment loss, if any. Subsequent cost \\nare included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as \\na separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable \\nthat future economic benefits associated with the item \\nwill flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be \\nmeasured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are \\ncharged to profit or loss during the reporting period in which \\nthey are incurred.\\nThough the Company measures investment property \\nusing cost based measurement, the fair value of \\ninvestment property is disclosed in the notes. Fair values \\nare determined based on an annual evaluation performed \\nby an accredited external independent valuer applying a \\nvaluation model recommended by the International Valuation \\nStandards Committee.\\n\\nNotes\\nto Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n132\\nNotes\\nThe Company depreciates its investment properties \\nover the useful life which is similar to that of Property, \\nPlant and Equipment.\\nInvestment properties are derecognised either when they \\nhave been disposed of or when they are permanently \\nwithdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is \\nexpected from their disposal. The difference between \\nthe net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount \\nof the asset is recognised in profit or loss in the period \\nof derecognition.\\n(f) Impairment of non financial assets\\nThe Company assesses, at each reporting date, whether \\nthere is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any \\nindication exists, or when annual impairment testing for \\nan asset is required, the Company estimates the asset’s \\nrecoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is \\nthe higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) \\nfair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. \\nRecoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, \\nunless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are \\nlargely independent of those from other assets or groups \\nof assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU \\nexceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered \\nimpaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.\\nIn assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows \\nare discounted to their present value using a pre-tax \\ndiscount rate that reflects current market assessments of \\nthe time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. \\nIn determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market \\ntransactions are taken into account.\\nImpairment losses are recognised in the statement of profit \\nand loss, except for properties previously revalued with the \\nrevaluation surplus taken to other comprehensive income.\\nFor assets, an assessment is made at each reporting date \\nto determine whether there is an indication that previously \\nrecognised impairment losses no longer exist or have \\ndecreased. If such indication exists, the Company estimates \\nthe asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously \\nrecognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has \\nbeen a change in the assumptions used to determine the \\nasset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss \\nwas recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying \\namount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, \\nnor exceed the carrying amount that would have been \\ndetermined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss \\nbeen recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is \\nrecognised in the statement of profit or loss unless the asset \\nis carried at a revalued amount, in which case, the reversal is \\ntreated as a revaluation increase.\\n(g) Leases\\nAs per Ind AS 116 “Leases”, the determination of whether \\nan arrangement is (or contains) a lease is based on the \\nsubstance of the arrangement at the inception of the lease. \\nThe arrangement is, or contains, a lease if fulfilment of the \\narrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset \\nor assets and the arrangement conveys a right-of-use the \\nasset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly specified in \\nan arrangement.\\n As a lessee\\nLeases are capitalised at the commencement of the lease \\nat the inception date fair value of the leased property or, if \\nlower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. \\nLease payments are apportioned between finance charges \\nand reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a \\nconstant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the \\nliability. Finance charges are recognised in finance costs \\nin the statement of profit and loss, unless they are directly \\nattributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are \\ncapitalised in accordance with the Company’s general policy \\non the borrowing costs. Contingent rentals are recognised \\nas expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.\\nA leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the \\nasset. However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the \\nCompany will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, \\nthe asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated \\nuseful life of the asset and the lease term.\\nLeases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards \\nof ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as \\noperating leases. Payments made under operating leases \\nare charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss on a \\nstraight-line basis over the period of the lease unless the \\npayments are structured to increase in line with expected \\ngeneral inflation to compensate for the lessor’s expected \\ninflationary cost increases.\\n Depreciation on right-of-use assets\\nDepreciation is provided on straight line method over the useful \\nlife of asset as assessed by the management. Depreciation is \\ncharged on pro-rata basis for asset purchased / sold during \\nthe year. The useful life of depreciation are reviewed and \\nadjusted if appropriate at the end of each reporting period.\\n As a lessor\\nLeases in which the Company does not transfer substantially \\nall the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are \\nclassified as operating leases. Rental income from operating \\nlease is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of \\nthe relevant lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating \\nand arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying \\namount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease\\n\\nNotes\\nto Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\n133\\nAvenue Supermarts Limited | ANNUAL REPORT FY 2023-24\\nterm on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents \\nare recognised as revenue in the period in which they are \\nearned unless the receipts are structured to increase in \\nline with expected general inflation to compensate for the \\nexpected inflationary cost increases.\\nLeases are classified as finance leases when substantially \\nall of the risks and rewards of ownership transfer from the \\nCompany to the lessee. Amounts due from lessees under \\nfinance leases are recorded as receivables at the Company’s \\nnet investment in the leases. Finance lease income is \\nallocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant \\nperiodic rate of return on the net investment outstanding in \\nrespect of the lease.\\n(h) Cash and cash equivalents\\nCash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprises \\ncash at banks and on hand and short term deposits with an \\noriginal maturity of three months or less, which are subject \\nto an insignificant risk of change in value. For the purpose \\nof standalone financial statement of cash flow, cash and \\ncash equivalent consists of cash and short term deposits, \\nas defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts \\nas they are considered an integral part of the Company’s \\ncash management.\\n(i) Trade receivables\\nTrade receivables are initially measured at transaction price \\nexcluding any financing arrangements in sale transactions \\nof the Company.\\n(j) Inventories\\nInventories are valued at lower of cost and net realizable \\nvalue. Cost of inventories, comprise costs of purchase \\nand other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their \\npresent condition and location. Cost is determined by \\nthe weighted average cost method. Costs of purchased \\ninventory are determined after deducting rebates and \\ndiscounts. Net realizable value is the estimated selling \\nprice in the ordinary course of business less the estimated \\ncosts of completion and the estimated cost necessary \\nto make the sale.\\n(k) Financial instruments\\nA Financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a \\nfinancial assets of one entity and a financial liability or equity \\ninstrument of another entity.\\n Financial asset\\n (i) Classification\\nThe Company classifies its financial assets in the \\nfollowing measurement categories:\\n *  those to be measured subsequently at fair value \\n(either through other comprehensive income, or \\nthrough the Statement of Profit and Loss), and\\n * those measured at amortised cost.\\nThe classification depends on the Company’s business \\nmodel for managing the financial assets and the \\ncontractual terms of the cash flows.\\nFor assets measured at fair value, gains and losses \\nwill either be recorded in the Statement of Profit and \\nLoss or other comprehensive income. For investments \\nin debt instruments, this will depend on the business \\nmodel in which the investment is held. For investments \\nin equity instruments, this will depend on whether \\nthe Company has made an irrevocable election at \\nthe time of initial recognition to account for the equity \\ninvestment at fair value through other comprehensive \\nincome. The Company reclassifies debt investments \\nwhen and only when its business model for managing \\nthose assets changes.\\n (ii) Measurement\\nAt initial recognition, the Company measures a financial \\nasset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset \\nnot at fair value through the Statement of Profit and \\nLoss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to \\nthe acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs \\nof financial assets carried at fair value through Profit and \\nLoss are expensed in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\\nFinancial assets with embedded derivatives are \\nconsidered in their entirety when determining \\nwhether their cash flows are solely payment of \\nprincipal and interest.\\n  Debt instruments:\\nSubsequent measurement of debt instruments \\ndepends on the Company’s business model for \\nmanaging the asset and the cash flow characteristics \\nof the asset. There are three measurement categories \\ninto which the Company classifies its debt instruments:\\n*  Amortised cost: A ‘debt instrument’ is measured \\nat the amortised cost if both the following \\nconditions are met:\\na) The asset is held within a business model \\nwhose objective is to hold assets for collecting \\ncontractual cash flows, and\\n\\nNotes\\nto Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n134\\nNotes\\nb) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified \\ndates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal \\nand interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.\\nthis category is the most relevant to the Company. After initial \\nmeasurement, such financial assets are subsequently \\nmeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate \\n(EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into \\naccount any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or \\ncosts that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation \\nis included in finance income in the profit or loss. The losses \\narising from impairment are recognised in the statement of \\nprofit and loss account. This category generally applies to \\ntrade and other receivables.\\n*  Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI): \\nA ‘debt instrument’ is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of \\nthe following criteria are met:\\na) The objective of the business model is achieved both \\nby collecting contractual cash flows and selling the \\nfinancial assets, and\\nb) The asset’s contractual cash flows represent SPPI.\\nDebt instruments included within the FVTOCI category \\nare measured initially as well as at each reporting date \\nat fair value. Fair value movements are recognised in \\nthe other comprehensive income (OCI). However, the \\nCompany recognizes interest income, impairment \\nlosses & reversals and foreign exchange gain or \\nloss in the statement of profit and loss account. \\nOn derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or \\nloss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from \\nthe equity to statement of profit and loss account. \\nInterest earned whilst holding FVTOCI debt instrument \\nis reported as interest income using the EIR method.\\n *  Fair value through profit and loss: FVTPL is a residual \\ncategory for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, \\nwhich does not meet the criteria for categorisation as at \\namortised cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL. \\nIn addition, the Company may elect to designate a debt \\ninstrument, which otherwise meets amortised cost or \\nFVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election \\nis allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a \\nmeasurement or recognition inconsistency (referred \\nto as ‘accounting mismatch’). The Company has \\nnot designated any debt instrument as at FVTPL. \\nDebt instruments included within the FVTPL category \\nare measured at fair value with all changes recognised \\nin the Statement of Profit and Loss.\\n  Equity instruments:\\nThe Company subsequently measures all equity \\ninvestments at fair value. Where the Company’s \\nmanagement has elected to present fair value gains and \\nlosses on equity investments in other comprehensive \\nincome, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair \\nvalue gains and losses to the Statement of Profit and \\nLoss. Dividends from such investments are recognised \\nin the Statement of Profit and Loss as other income \\nwhen the Company’s right to receive payments \\nis established.\\nChanges in the fair value of financial assets at fair \\nvalue through the Statement of Profit and Loss are \\nrecognised in other income / other expenses in the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss. Impairment losses (and \\nreversal of impairment losses) on equity investments \\nmeasured at FVTOCI are not reported separately from \\nother changes in fair value.\\n (iii) Impairment of financial assets\\nThe Company assesses on a forward looking basis \\nthe expected credit losses associated with its \\nassets carried at amortised cost and FVTOCI debt \\ninstruments. The impairment methodology applied \\ndepends on whether there has been a significant \\nincrease in credit risk.\\nFor trade receivables only, the Company applies the \\nsimplified approach permitted by Ind AS 109 Financial \\nInstruments, which requires expected lifetime losses to \\nbe recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.\\n (iv) Derecognition of financial assets\\nA financial asset is derecognised only when\\n*  the Company has transferred the rights to receive \\ncash flows from the financial asset or\\n*  retains the contractual rights to receive the \\ncash flows of the financial asset, but assumes a \\ncontractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or \\nmore recipients.\\nWhere the Company has transferred an asset, \\nthe Company evaluates whether it has transferred \\nsubstantially all risks and rewards of the financial asset. \\nIn such cases, the financial asset is derecognised. \\nWhere the Company has not transferred substantially \\nall risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, \\nthe financial asset is not derecognised.\\n\\nNotes\\nto Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\n135\\nAvenue Supermarts Limited | ANNUAL REPORT FY 2023-24\\nWhere the Company has neither transferred a financial \\nasset nor retains substantially all risks and rewards of \\nownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is \\nderecognised if the Company has not retained control \\nof the financial asset. Where the Company retains \\ncontrol of the financial asset, the asset is continued to \\nbe recognised to the extent of continuing involvement \\nin the financial asset.\\n Financial liabilities\\n (i) Offsetting financial instruments\\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net \\namount is reported in the balance sheet where there \\nis a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised \\namounts and there is an intention to settle on a \\nnet basis or realise the asset and settle the liability \\nsimultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not \\nbe contingent on future events and must be enforceable \\nin the normal course of business and in the event of \\ndefault insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company or \\nthe counterparty.\\n (ii) Trade and other payables\\nThese amount represent liabilities for goods and \\nservices provided to the Company prior to the end \\nof financial year which are unpaid. The amounts are \\nunsecured. Trade and other payables are presented as \\ncurrent liabilities unless payment is not due within 12 \\nmonths after the reporting period. They are recognised \\ninitially at their fair value and subsequently measured \\nat amortised cost using the effective interest method.\\n (iii) Borrowings and other financial liabilities\\nBorrowings and other financial liabilities are initially \\nrecognised at fair value (net of transaction costs \\nincurred). Difference between the fair value and the \\ntransaction proceeds on initiation is recognised as \\nan asset / liability based on the underlying reason \\nfor the difference. Subsequently all financial liabilities \\nare measured at amortised cost using the effective \\ninterest rate method.\\nBorrowings are removed from the balance sheet when \\nthe obligation specified in the contract is discharged, \\ncancelled or expired. The difference between the \\ncarrying amount of a financial liability that has been \\nextinguished or transferred to another party and the \\nconsideration paid, including any non-cash transferred \\nor liabilities assumed, is recognised in the Statement of \\nProfit and Loss.\\nBorrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the \\nCompany has an unconditional right to defer settlement \\nof the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting \\nperiod. Where there is a breach of a material provision \\nof a long-term loan arrangement on or before the end \\nof the reporting period with the effect that the liability \\nbecomes payable on demand on the reporting date, \\nthe entity does not classify the liability as current, if the \\nlender agreed, after the reporting period and before the \\napproval of the financial statements for issue, not to \\ndemand payment as a consequence of the breach.\\n (iv) Borrowing costs\\nGeneral and specific borrowing costs that are directly \\nattributable to the acquisition or construction of \\nqualifying assets are capitalised during the period \\nof time that is required to complete and prepare the \\nasset for its intended use. Other borrowing costs are \\nexpensed in the period in which they are incurred.\\nInvestment income earned on the temporary investment \\nof specific borrowings pending their expenditure on \\nqualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs \\neligible for capitalisation.\\nBorrowing cost consist of interest and other cost that \\nan entity incurs in connection with borrowing of funds.\\n (v) Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\\nProvisions are recognised when the Company has a \\npresent legal or constructive obligation as a result of \\npast events, it is probable that an outflow of resources \\nembodying economic benefit will be required to settle \\nthe obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.\\nProvisions are measured at the present value of \\nmanagement’s best estimate of the expenditure \\nrequired to settle the present obligation at the end of the \\nreporting period. The discount rate used to determine \\nthe present value is a pre tax rate that reflects current \\nmarket assessments of the time value of money and \\nthe risks specific to the liability. The increase in the \\nprovision due to the passage of time is recognised \\nas finance cost.\\nContingent Liabilities are disclosed in respect of \\npossible obligations that arise from past events but \\ntheir existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or \\nnon occurrence of one or more uncertain future events \\nnot wholly within the control of the Company or where \\nany present obligation cannot be measured in terms of \\nfuture outflow of resources or where a reliable estimate \\nof the obligation cannot be made.\\nA contingent asset is disclosed, where an inflow of \\neconomic benefits is probable. An entity shall not\\n\\nNotes\\nto Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n136\\nNotes\\nrecognize a contingent asset unless the recovery is \\nvirtually certain.\\n(l) Revenue Recognition\\nRevenue from operations is recognised to the extent that it is \\nprobable that economic benefit will flow to the Company and \\nthe revenue can be reliably measured regardless of when the \\npayment is being made as per IND AS 115.\\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognised when \\nthe control/title of the goods or services are transferred to \\nthe customer at an amount of transaction price allocated to \\nthat performance obligation that reflects the consideration \\nto which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange \\nfor those goods or services excluding government duties \\ncollected on behalf of the Government.In determining the \\ntransaction price of goods sold and services rendered, the \\nCompany excludes the effect of any variable consideration \\non account of various discounts and schemes offered by the \\nCompany as a part of the Contract.\\nIt is the Company’s policy to sell its products to the \\nend customers with the right of return of 7 days. \\nHistorical experience is used to estimate and provide for \\nsuch returns at the time of sale.\\nThe Company has generally concluded that it is the principal \\nin its revenue arrangements, except for the agency services \\nbelow, because it typically controls the goods or services \\nbefore transferring them to the customer.\\n Principal versus agent consideration\\nThe inventory of third party does not pass to the Company \\ntill the product is sold. At the time of sale of such inventory, \\nthe sales value along with the cost of inventory is disclosed \\nseprately as sale of goods on approval basis and cost of \\ngoods sold on approval basis and forms part of Revenue \\nin the Statement of Profit and Loss. Only the net revenue \\nearned i.e. margin is recorded as a part of revenue.\\n Rental income\\nRental income arising from operating lease on investment \\nproperties is accounted for on a straight line basis over \\nlease terms unless the receipts are structured to increase \\nin line with expected general inflation to compensate for the \\nexpected inflationary cost increases and is included in the \\nStatement of profit and loss due to its operating nature.\\n Interest income\\nInterest income is recongnised based on time proportion \\nbasis considering the amount outstanding and rate \\napplicable (EIR). Interest income in included in the Other \\nIncome in the statement of Profit and Loss.\\n(m) Retirement and other employee benefits\\n (i) Short-term obligations\\nLiabilities for wages and salaries, including \\nnon-monetary benefits that are expected to be settled \\nwholly within 12 months after the end of the period \\nin which the employees render the related service \\nare recognised in respect of employees’ services up \\nto the end of the reporting period and are measured \\nat the amounts expected to be paid when the \\nliabilities are settled.\\nRetirement benefit in the form of provident fund is \\na defined contribution plan. The Company has no \\nobligation , other than the contribution payable to the \\nprovident fund. The Company recognises contribution \\npayable to the provident fund scheme as an expense, \\nwhen an employee renders the related services. If the \\nContribution payable to the scheme for service received \\nbefore the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution \\nalready paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is \\nrecognised as a liability after deducting the contribution \\nalready paid. If the contribution already paid exceeds \\nthe contribution due for services received before the \\nbalance sheet date,then excess is recognised as an \\nasset to the extent that the prepayment will lead to a \\nreduction in future payment or a cash refund.\\n ii) Other long-term employee benefit obligations\\nThe liabilities for earned leave and sick leave that are \\nnot expected to be settled wholly within 12 months \\nare measured at the present value of expected future \\npayments to be made in respect of services provided \\nby employees up to the end of the reporting period \\nusing the projected unit credit method. The benefits are \\ndiscounted using the Government Securities (G-Sec) \\nat the end of the reporting period that have terms \\napproximating to the terms of the related obligation. \\nRemeasurements as a result of experience adjustments \\nand changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised \\nin the Statement of Profit and Loss.\\nThe obligations are presented as current liabilities \\nin the balance sheet if the entity does not have an \\nunconditional right to defer settlement for at least \\ntwelve months after the reporting period, regardless of \\nwhen the actual settlement is expected to occur.\\n iii) Post-employment obligations\\n  Defined benefit plans\\n  Gratuity\\nThe liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet \\nin respect of defined benefit gratuity plans is the \\npresent value of the defined benefit obligation at the \\nend of the reporting period less the fair value of plan\\n\\nNotes\\nto Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\n137\\nAvenue Supermarts Limited | ANNUAL REPORT FY 2023-24\\nassets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated \\nannually by independent actuary using the projected \\nunit credit method. The present value of the defined \\nbenefit obligation denominated in INR is determined \\nby discounting the estimated future cash outflows by \\nreference to market yields at the end of the reporting \\nperiod on government bonds that have terms \\napproximating to the terms of the related obligation.\\nThe net interest cost is calculated by applying the \\ndiscount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit \\nobligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is \\nincluded in employee benefit expense in the Statement \\nof Profit and Loss. Remeasurement gains and losses \\narising from experience adjustments and changes in \\nactuarial assumptions are recognised in the period \\nin which they occur, directly in other comprehensive \\nincome. They are included in retained earnings in the \\nstatement of changes in equity and in the balance \\nsheet. Changes in the present value of the defined \\nbenefit obligation resulting from plan amendments \\nor curtailments are recognised immediately in the \\nStatement of profit and loss as past service cost.\\n  Share based payment\\nEquity settled share based payments to employees \\nand other providing similar services are measured at \\nfair value of the equity instruments at grant date.\\nThe fair value determined at the grant date of the \\nequity-settled share based payment is expensed on a \\nstraight line basis over the vesting period, based on \\nthe Company’s estimate of equity instruments that will \\neventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity. \\nAt the end of each reporting period , the Company \\nrevises its estimates of the number of equity instruments \\nexpected to vest. The impact of the revision of the \\noriginal estimates, if any is , recongised in Statement \\nof Profit and Loss such that the cumulative expenses \\nreflects the revised estimate,with a corresponding \\nadjustment to the shared option outstanding account.\\nNo expense is recognised for options that do not \\nultimately vest because non market performance \\nand/or service conditions have not been met.\\nThe dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as \\nadditional share dilution in the computation of diluted \\nearnings per share.\\nExpense relating to options granted to employees of the \\nsubsidiaries under the Company’s share based payment \\nplan, is recovered from the subsidiaries. Such recovery \\nis reduced from employee benefit expense.\\n(n) Foreign currency transactions\\n (a) Functional and presentation currency:\\nItems included in the financial statements of the \\nCompany are measured using the currency of the \\nprimary economic environment in which the entity \\noperates. The standalone financial statements \\nare presented in INR, which is functional and \\npresentational currency.\\n (b) Transaction and balances :\\nTransaction in currencies other than than entity’s \\nfunctional currency (foreign currencies) are recognised \\nat the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of \\nthe transaction.\\nExchange differences arising on settlement or \\ntranslation of monetary items are recognised in the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss.\\nNon monetary items carried at fair value that are \\ndenominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at \\nthe rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was \\ndetermined. Non-monetary items that are measured in \\nterms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not \\nretranslated. The gain or loss arising on translation of \\nnon-monetary items measured at fair value is treated \\nin line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the \\nchange in fair value of the item.\\n(o) Income tax\\n a) Current Tax\\nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities are measured \\nat the amount expected to be recovered from or paid \\nto the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws \\nused to compute the amount are those that enacted \\nor substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the \\ncountries where The Company operates and generates \\ntaxable income.\\n b) Deferred tax\\nDeferred income tax is provided using the liability \\nmethod on temporary differences arising between the \\ntax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying \\namount for financial reporting purpose at the reporting \\ndate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined \\nusing tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or \\nsubstantially enacted by the end of the reporting period \\nand are expected to apply when the asset is realised or \\nthe liability is settled.\\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible \\ntemporary differences and unused tax losses, only if, it \\nis probable that future taxable amounts will be available \\nto utilise those temporary differences and losses.\\n\\nNotes\\nto Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n138\\nNotes\\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there \\nis a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets \\nand liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate \\nto the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and \\ntax liabilities are off set where The Company has a \\nlegally enforceable right to offset and intends either to \\nsettle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle \\nthe liability simultaneously.\\nCurrent and deferred tax is recognised in the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss, except to the extent that \\nit relates to items recognised in other comprehensive \\nincome or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also \\nrecognised in other comprehensive income or directly \\nin equity, respectively\\n(p) Earnings Per Share\\n Basic earnings per share\\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing:\\n- the profit attributable to equity shareholder of the  \\nCompany\\n- by the weighted average number of equity shares \\noutstanding during the financial year\\n Diluted earnings per share\\nDiluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the \\ndetermination of basic earnings per share to take into \\naccount:\\n- the after income tax effect of interest and other \\nfinancing costs associated with dilutive potential \\nequity shares, and\\n- the weighted average number of additional equity \\nshares that would have been outstanding assuming \\nthe conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.\\n(q) Fair value measurement\\nThe Company measures financial instrument at fair value at \\neach Balance sheet date.\\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell assets \\nor paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between \\nmarket participant at the measurement date.\\xa0\\nThe fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are \\nincluded at the amount at which the instrument could be \\nexchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, \\nother than in a forced or liquidation sale.\\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to \\nestimate the fair values:\\n1. Fair value of cash and deposits, trade and other \\nreceivables, trade payables and other current liabilities, \\napproximate their carrying amounts largely due to short \\nterm maturities of these instruments.\\n2. The fair values of non-current borrowings are based \\non discounted cash flows using a current borrowing \\nrate. They are classified as level 3 fair values in the fair \\nvalue hierarchy due to the use of unobservable inputs, \\nincluding own credit risk.\\n3. For financial assets and liabilities that are measured \\nat fair value, the carrying amounts are equal to \\nthe fair values.\\nThe Company uses the following hierarchy for determining \\nand disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by \\nvaluation technique:\\nLevel 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for \\nidentical assets or liabilities.\\nLevel 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a \\nsignificant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, \\neither directly or indirectly.\\nLevel 3: techniques which use inputs that have a significant \\neffect on the recorded fair value that are not based on \\nobservable market data.\\n(r)  Significant accounting judgement, estimates and \\nassumption\\nThe preparation of standalone financial statements requires \\nthe use of accounting estimates which by definition \\nwill seldom equal the actual results. Management also \\nneed to exercise judgement in applying the Company’s \\naccounting policies.\\n Share based payment\\nThe Company initially measures the cost of equity \\nsettled transaction with employees using Black Scholes \\nmodel to determine the fair value of the liability incurred. \\nEstimating fair value for share-based payment transaction \\nrequires determination of the most appropriate valuation \\nmodel, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of \\nthe grant. The estimates also requires determination of the \\nmost appropriate inputs to the valuation model including \\nexpected life of the share option, volatility and dividend yield\\n\\nNotes\\nto Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\n139\\nAvenue Supermarts Limited | ANNUAL REPORT FY 2023-24\\nand making assumptions about them.For equity settled \\nshare based payment transaction, the liability needs to be \\nre-measured at the end of each reporting period upto the \\ndate of settlement, with any changes in fair value recognised \\nin the Statement of Profit and Loss. This requires a \\nre-assessment of the estimates used at end of each reporting \\nperiod. The assumption and models used for estimating the \\nfair value for share based-payment transaction are disclosed \\nin note no. 43.\\n Provision for inventory\\nThe Company has calculated the provision for inventory \\nbasis the percentage as per historical experience for \\ninventory lying from the last inventory count date to the \\nreporting date.\\nAn inventory provision is also recognised for cases where the \\nrealisable value is estimated to be lower than the inventory \\ncarrying value. The inventory provision is estimated taking \\ninto account various factors, including prevailing sales \\nprices of inventory item, the seasonality of the item’s sales \\nprofile and losses associated with obsolete / slow-moving \\ninventory items.\\n Defined benefit plans (gratuity benefits)\\nThe cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and other \\npost-employment medical benefits and the present value \\nof the gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial \\nvaluations. An actuarial valuation involves making various \\nassumptions that may differ from actual developments in \\nthe future. These include the determination of the discount \\nrate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the \\ncomplexities involved in the valuation and its long-term \\nnature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to \\nchanges in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed \\nat each reporting date.\\nThe parameter most subject to change is the discount \\nrate. In determining the appropriate discount rate for plans \\noperated in India, the management considers the interest \\nrates of government bonds in currencies consistent with the \\ncurrencies of the post-employment benefit obligation.\\nThe mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality \\ntables for the specific countries. Those mortality tables \\ntend to change only at interval in response to demographic \\nchanges. Future salary increases and gratuity increases are \\nbased on expected future inflation rates.\\nFurther details about gratuity obligations are given in \\nnote no. 44.\\n(s) Segment reporting\\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent \\nwith the internal reporting provided to the chief operating \\ndecision maker being Managing Director of the Company . \\nThe Managing Director assesses the financial performance \\nand position of the Company as a whole, and makes \\nstrategic decisions.\\n(t) Cash flow\\nThe investing and financing activities in cash flow statement \\ndo not have a direct impact on current cash flows although \\nthey do affect the capital and asset structure of an entity. \\nThe Company has disclosed these transactions, to the \\nextent material, in notes to cash flow statement.\\n\\nNotes\\nto Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\n2 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\\n(` in Crores)\\nFreehold land \\n(Refer note \\n: 2,6)\\nBuildings \\n(Refer \\nnote : 1,5)\\nLeasehold \\nimprovement\\nPlant and \\nequipment\\nComputers Furniture \\nand \\nfixtures\\nVehicles Office \\nequipment\\nElectrical \\ninstallations\\nTotal\\nCost\\nBalance as at 1st \\nApril, 2022\\n 3,656.66  3,849.36  85.90  434.22  122.58  410.07  3.44  48.94  320.80  8,931.97 \\nAdditions  876.14  1,039.13  11.88  141.70  27.88  89.59  0.68  11.72  86.68  2,285.40 \\nReclassification  8.34  10.21  -

A fall in the discount rate generally increases the mark to market value of the assets depending on \\nthe duration of asset.\\nSalary risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of members. \\nAs such, an increase in the salary of the members more than assumed level will increase the plan’s liability.\\nInvestment risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined \\nby reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds. If the return on plan asset is below this \\nrate, it will create a plan deficit. Currently, for the plan in India, it has a relatively balanced mix of investments in government \\nsecurities and other debt instruments.\\n165\\nAvenue Supermarts Limited | ANNUAL REPORT FY 2023-24\\n\\nNotes\\nto Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\nAsset liability matching risk: The plan faces the ALM risk as to the matching cash flow. Since the plan is invested in lines of \\nrule 101 of Income Tax Rules, 1962, this generally reduces ALM risk.\\nMortality risk: Since the benefits under the plan is not payable for life time and payable till retirement age only, plan does not \\nhave any longevity risk.\\nConcentration risk: Plan is having a concentration risk as all the assets are invested with the insurance Companies.\\n45   FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\\n Financial risk management objectives and policies\\nThe Company’s financial principal liabilities comprises lease liabilities, trade payables and other payables.

We believe that the audit evidence we have \\nobtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our \\naudit opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\\nKey Audit Matters\\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional \\njudgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated \\nfinancial statements for the financial year ended 31st March, 2024. \\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the \\nconsolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our \\nopinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on \\nthese matters. For each matter below, our description of how our \\naudit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\\nWe have determined the matters described below to be the key \\naudit matters to be communicated in our report. We have fulfilled \\nthe responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for \\nthe audit of the consolidated financial statements section of our \\nreport, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our \\naudit included the performance of procedures designed to \\nrespond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement \\nof the consolidated financial statements. The results of \\naudit procedures performed by us and by other auditors of \\ncomponents not audited by us, as reported by them in their audit \\nreports furnished to us by the management, including those \\nprocedures performed to address the matters below, provide the \\nbasis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated \\nfinancial statements.\\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n172 Independent Auditors’ Report\\n\\nKey audit matters How our audit addressed the key audit matter\\nCapital expenditure in respect of land and buildings \\n(as described in note 1.c and 2 of the consolidated financial statements)\\nThe Holding Company has incurred significant expenditure on \\npurchase/construction of land and building as reflected by the total \\nvalue of additions in property, plant and equipment and capital work in \\nprogress in notes 2 in the consolidated financial statements.\\nThe Holding Company is in the process of constructing new stores \\nacross locations for which land has been purchased and buildings are \\nbeing constructed. These stores take substantial period of time to get \\nready for its intended use.\\nWe considered capital expenditure in respect of land and building as a \\nKey audit matter due to significance of amount incurred on such items \\nduring the year. \\nOur audit procedures included the following:\\nWe obtained understanding, evaluated the design and tested the \\noperating effectiveness of controls related to capital expenditure of land \\nand buildings.\\nWe obtained the list of land parcels purchased during the year and \\ntraced the amounts of capitalisation with the title deeds and traced \\nthe expenses capitalised along with the land cost to the underlying \\ninvoices.\\nFor samples selected, we obtained the approvals of the authorised \\nsignatory for the purchase of land parcel.\\nWe performed control testing on a sample basis for each element of \\ncapitalised costs of building and reconciliation of material performed by \\nmanagement including verification of underlying supporting evidence \\nand understanding nature of the costs capitalised.\\nWe compared the total cost of addition of sample stores with \\nmanagement budgets.\\nWe obtained understanding on management assessment relating to \\nprogress of projects and their intention to bring the asset to its intended \\nuse.\\nInventory existence and allowance for inventory \\n(as described in note 1.k and 1.s of the consolidated financial statements)\\nAs at 31st March, 2024, the carrying amount of inventories amounted \\nto ` 3,927.31 crore after considering allowances for Inventory \\ntowards shrinkage and slow moving inventory of ` 58.10 crore. These \\ninventories are held at the stores and distribution centers of the Group.\\nThe management undertakes the physical verification of inventory at \\nperiodic intervals during the year and shrinkages if any are recorded \\nin the books. The total amount of shrinkage and damage recorded \\nduring the year amounts to ` 173.67 crore\\nBasis the actual shrinkages recorded, the management estimates the \\nexpected allowance for Inventory shrinkage from the date of the last \\nphysical verification till the balance sheet date.\\nFurther, there are a number of judgements required in assessing \\nthe appropriate level of allowance for slow moving inventory. Such \\njudgements include management’s expectations of forecast inventory \\ndemand, product expiry dates and plans to dispose of inventories that \\nare close to expiry.\\nConsidering the wide spread inventory of the Group and the \\njudgements applied for determining the allowance, we consider the \\nexistence and allowance for inventories to be a key audit matter.\\nOur procedures over existence and allowance for inventory included \\nthe following:\\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the \\noperating effectiveness of controls that the Group has in relation to the \\ninventory count process and allowance for inventory;\\nWe performed testing on the Group’s controls over the inventory count \\nprocess. In testing these controls we observed the inventory count \\nprocess at selected store and distribution centers on a sample basis, \\ninspected the results of the inventory count and confirmed variances \\nincluding damaged and shrinkages were accounted for and approved \\nby management.\\nAssessed the stock shrinkage provision by assessing the level of \\ninventory write downs during the period and applying the shrinkage \\nrate as determined location wise to the year end stock. We tested on a \\nsample basis the shrinkage rate used to calculate the provision for each \\nstore and distribution center.\\nWe evaluated the assumptions made by management, and particularly \\nthe key assumption that in assessing stock obsolescence provisions \\nthrough an analysis of inventory items by category and age and the \\nlevel of inventory write downs in these categories during the period\\nWe assessed the Group’s disclosures concerning this in Note 1.k and \\n1.s on significant accounting estimates and judgements and Note 10 \\nInventories to the consolidated financial statements\\nWe have determined that there are no other key audit matters to communicate in our report.\\n173\\nAvenue Supermarts Limited | ANNUAL REPORT FY 2023-24\\n\\nOther than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report \\nThereon\\nThe Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for \\nthe other information.

If, based on the work we have performed, \\nwe conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other \\ninformation, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing \\nto report in this regard.\\nResponsibilities of Management for the Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements\\nThe Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for \\nthe preparation and presentation of these consolidated financial \\nstatements in terms of the requirements of the Act that give a true \\nand fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated \\nfinancial performance including other comprehensive income, \\nconsolidated cash flows and consolidated statement of changes \\nin equity of the Group in accordance with the accounting principles \\ngenerally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting \\nStandards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read \\nwith the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, \\nas amended. The respective Board of Directors of the companies \\nincluded in the Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate \\naccounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for \\nsafeguarding of the assets of their respective companies and for \\npreventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection \\nand application of appropriate accounting policies; making \\njudgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and \\nthe design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal \\nfinancial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the \\naccuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant \\nto the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial \\nstatements that give a true and fair view and are free from material \\nmisstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been \\nused for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial \\nstatements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.\\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective \\nBoard of Directors of the companies included in the Group are \\nresponsible for assessing the ability of their respective companies \\nto continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, \\nmatters related to going concern and using the going concern \\nbasis of accounting unless management either intends to \\nliquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic \\nalternative but to do so.\\nThose respective Board of Directors of the companies included \\nin the Group are also responsible for overseeing the financial \\nreporting process of their respective companies.\\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements\\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether \\nthe consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from \\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue \\nan auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance \\nis a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit \\nconducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material \\nmisstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from \\nfraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in \\nthe aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence \\nthe economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these \\nconsolidated financial statements.\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise \\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism \\nthroughout the audit. We also:\\n• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the \\nconsolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or \\nerror, design and perform audit procedures responsive to \\nthose risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and \\nappropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of \\nnot detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is \\nhigher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve \\ncollusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, \\nor the override of internal control.\\n• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the \\naudit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate \\nin the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we \\nare also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether \\nthe Holding Company has adequate internal financial \\ncontrols with reference to financial statements in place and \\nthe operating effectiveness of such controls.\\n• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used \\nand the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related \\ndisclosures made by management.\\n• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of \\nthe going concern basis of accounting and, based on the \\naudit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty \\nexists related to events or conditions that may cast significant \\ndoubt on the ability of the Group to continue as a going \\nconcern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we \\nare required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the \\nrelated disclosures in the consolidated financial statements \\nor, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. \\nOur conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained \\nup to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events \\nor conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as \\na going concern.\\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n174 Independent Auditors’ Report\\n\\n• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the \\nconsolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, \\nand whether the consolidated financial statements represent \\nthe underlying transactions and events in a manner that \\nachieves fair presentation.\\n• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the \\nfinancial information of the entities or business activities \\nwithin the Group of which we are the independent auditors \\nand whose financial information we have audited, to express \\nan opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are \\nresponsible for the direction, supervision and performance of \\nthe audit of the financial statements of such entities included \\nin the consolidated financial statements of which we are the \\nindependent auditors. For the other entities included in the \\nconsolidated financial statements, which have been audited \\nby other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible \\nfor the direction, supervision and performance of the audits \\ncarried out by them. We remain solely responsible for \\nour audit opinion.\\nWe communicate with those charged with governance of \\nthe Holding Company and such other entities included in the \\nconsolidated financial statements of which we are the independent \\nauditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope \\nand timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including \\nany significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify \\nduring our audit.\\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement \\nthat we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding \\nindependence, and to communicate with them all relationships \\nand other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our \\nindependence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with \\ngovernance, we determine those matters that were of most \\nsignificance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements \\nfor the financial year ended 31 st March, 2024 and are therefore \\nthe key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s \\nreport unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure \\nabout the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we \\ndetermine that a matter should not be communicated in our \\nreport because the adverse consequences of doing so would \\nreasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits \\nof such communication.\\nOther Matter\\nWe did not audit the financial statements and other financial \\ninformation, in respect of 3 subsidiaries, whose financial \\nstatements include total assets of ` 88.68 crore as at 31st March, \\n2024, and total revenues of ` 182.06 crore and net cash inflows \\nof ` 1.09 crore for the year ended on that date.

We conducted our audit in \\naccordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial \\nControls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the \\nStandards on Auditing, specified under section 143(10) of the Act, \\nto the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, \\nboth, issued by ICAI.

Our audit of internal financial controls \\nwith reference to consolidated financial statements included \\nobtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with \\nreference to consolidated financial statements, assessing the \\nrisk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating \\nthe design and operating effectiveness of internal control based \\non the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the \\nauditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of \\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due \\nto fraud or error.\\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the \\naudit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their \\nreports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is \\nsufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion \\non the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated \\nfinancial statements.\\nMeaning of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to \\nConsolidated Financial Statements\\nA company’s internal financial control with reference to \\nconsolidated financial statements is a process designed to \\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial \\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external \\npurposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting \\nprinciples. A company’s internal financial control with reference \\nto consolidated financial statements includes those policies and \\nprocedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in \\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and \\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable \\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to \\npermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with \\ngenerally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and \\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance \\nwith authorisations of management and directors of the company; \\nand (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or \\ntimely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition \\nof the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the \\nfinancial statements.\\nInherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls With \\nReference to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls \\nwith reference to consolidated financial statements, including \\nthe possibility of collusion or improper management override of \\ncontrols, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur \\nand not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the \\ninternal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial \\nstatements to future periods are subject to the risk that the \\ninternal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial \\nstatements may become inadequate because of changes in \\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or \\nprocedures may deteriorate.\\nOpinion\\nIn our opinion, the Group , which are companies incorporated \\nin India, have, maintained in all material respects, adequate \\ninternal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial \\nstatements and such internal financial controls with reference to \\nconsolidated financial statements were operating effectively as \\nat 31st March,2024, based on the internal control over financial \\nreporting criteria established by the Holding Company considering \\nthe essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance \\nNote issued by the ICAI.\\nOther Matters\\nOur report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy \\nand operating effectiveness of the internal financial controls with \\nreference to consolidated financial statements of the Holding \\nCompany, in so far as it relates to these three subsidiaries, \\nwhich are companies incorporated in India, is based on the \\ncorresponding reports of the auditors of such subsidiaries \\nincorporated in India.\\nFor S R B C & CO LLP\\nChartered Accountants\\nICAI Firm Registration Number: 324982E/E300003\\nper Vikram Mehta\\nPartner\\nMembership No.: 105938\\nUDIN: 24105938BKELXL3455\\nThane, 4th May, 2024\\n179\\nAvenue Supermarts Limited | ANNUAL REPORT FY 2023-24'),\n",

The consolidated \\nfinancial statements comprises the financial statement of the \\nHolding Company and its susidiaries, together are referred to \\nas “the Group”.\\nThe consolidated financial statements have been recommended \\nfor approval by the audit committee and is approved and adopted \\nby the Board in their meeting held at Thane, 4th May, 2024.\\n1. SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\n(a) Statement of compliance and basis of preparation\\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared \\nin accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards \\n(hereinafter referred to as the ‘Ind AS’) as notified by \\nMinistry of Corporate Affairs pursuant to Section 133 of the \\nCompanies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’) read with the Companies \\n(Indian Accounting standards) Rules as amended from time \\nto time and other relevant provisions of the Act\\nThe accounting policies are applied consistently to all the \\nperiods presented in the consolidated financial statements.\\n (i) Historical cost convention\\nThe consolidated financial statements have been \\nprepared on a historical cost basis, except for the \\nfollowing:\\n1) certain financial assets and liabilities that are \\nmeasured at fair value;\\n2) defined benefit plans - plan assets measured at \\nfair value;\\n3) share based payments.\\n (ii) Current non-current classification\\nThe Group presents assets and liabilities in the balance \\nsheet based on current and non-current classification. \\nAs asset is treated as current when it is:\\n- Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or \\nconsumed in normal operating cycle\\n- Held primarily for the purpose of trading\\n- Expected to be realised within twelve months \\nafter the reporting period, or\\n- Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from \\nbeing exchanged or used to settle a liability for at \\nleast twelve months after the reporting period\\nAll other assets are classified as non-current.\\nA liability is current when:\\n- It is expected to be settled in normal operating \\ncycle\\n- It is held primarily for the purpose of trading\\n- It is due to be settled within twelve months after \\nthe reporting period, or\\n- There is no unconditional right to defer the \\nsettlement of the liability for at least twelve months \\nafter the reporting period.\\nThe Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current.\\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as \\nnon-current assets and liabilities.\\nThe operating cycle is the time between the acquisition \\nof assets for processing and their realisation in cash \\nand cash equivalents. The Group has identified twelve \\nmonths as its operating cycle.\\n (iii) Rounding off amounts\\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented \\nin ` and all values are rounded to the nearest ` 0.00 \\ncrores , except when otherwise indicated.\\n (iv) Going Concern\\nThe Group has prepared the financial statements on the \\nbasis that it will continue to operate as a going concern.\\n(b ) Basis of consolidation\\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial \\nstatements of the holding company and its subsidiaries as \\nat 31st March, 2024. Control is achieved when the Group is \\nexposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement \\nwith the investee and has the ability to affect those returns \\nthrough its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group \\ncontrols an investee if and only if the Group has:\\n- Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give \\nit the current ability to direct the relevant activities \\nof the investee)\\n\\nNotes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\n187\\nAvenue Supermarts Limited | ANNUAL REPORT FY 2023-24\\n- Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its \\ninvolvement with the investee, and\\n- The ability to use its power over the investee to affect \\nits returns Generally, there is a presumption that a \\nmajority of voting rights result in control. To support \\nthis presumption and when the Group has less \\nthan a majority of the voting or similar rights of an \\ninvestee, the Group considers all relevant facts and \\ncircumstances in assessing whether it has power over \\nan investee, including:\\n- The contractual arrangement with the other vote \\nholders of the investee\\n- Rights arising from other contractual arrangements \\n- The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights\\n- The size of the Group’s holding of voting rights relative \\nto the size and dispersion of the holdings of the other \\nvoting rights holders\\nThe Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee \\nif facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to \\none or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation \\nof a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over \\nthe subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control \\nof the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses \\nof a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are \\nincluded in the consolidated financial statements from the \\ndate the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases \\nto control the subsidiary. \\nConsolidated financial statements are prepared using \\nuniform accounting policies for like transactions and other \\nevents in similar circumstances. If a member of the Group \\nuses accounting policies other than those adopted in the \\nconsolidated financial statements for like transactions and \\nevents in similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments \\nare made to that Group member’s financial statements in \\npreparing the consolidated financial statements to ensure \\nconformity with the Group’s accounting policies.\\nThe financial statements of all entities used for the purpose \\nof consolidation are drawn up to same reporting date as \\nthat of the Holding company, i.e., year ended on 31 st March, \\n2024. When the end of the reporting period of the holding \\ncompany is different from that of a subsidiary, the subsidiary \\nprepares, for consolidation purposes, additional financial \\ninformation as of the same date as the financial statements \\nof the holding company to enable the holding company to \\nconsolidate the financial information of the subsidiary, unless \\nit is impracticable to do so.\\n Consolidation procedure:\\n(a) Combine like items of assets, liabilities, equity, \\nincome, expenses and cash flows of the holding \\ncompany with those of its subsidiary. For this \\npurpose, income and expenses of the subsidiary are \\nbased on the amounts of the assets and liabilities \\nrecognised in the consolidated financial statements at \\nthe acquisition date.\\n(b) Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of the Holding \\ncompany investment in each subsidiary and the \\nHolding company’s portion of equity of each subsidiary. \\nBusiness combinations policy explains how to account \\nfor any related goodwill.\\n(c) Eliminate in full intraGroup assets and liabilities, \\nequity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to \\ntransactions between entities of the Group (profits \\nor losses resulting from intraGroup transactions that \\nare recognised in assets, such as inventory and fixed \\nassets, are eliminated in full). IntraGroup losses may \\nindicate an impairment that requires recognition in the \\nconsolidated financial statements. Ind AS 12 Income \\nTaxes applies to temporary differences that arise from \\nthe elimination of profits and losses resulting from \\nintraGroup transactions.\\nProfit or loss and each component of other \\ncomprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the \\nequity holders of the holding of the Group and to \\nthe non-controlling interests, even if this results in \\nthe non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. \\nWhen necessary, adjustments are made to the financial \\nstatements of subsidiary to bring their accounting \\npolicies into line with the Group’s accounting policies. \\nAll intra-Group assets and liabilities, equity, income, \\nexpenses and cash flows relating to transactions \\nbetween members of the Group are eliminated in full \\non consolidation.\\nA change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, \\nwithout a loss of control, is accounted for as an \\nequity transaction. If the Group loses control over a \\nsubsidiary, it:\\n- Derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and \\nliabilities of the subsidiary\\n- Derecognises the carrying amount of any \\nnon-controlling interests \\n- Derecognises the cumulative translation \\ndifferences recorded in equity\\n\\nNotes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n188\\nNotes\\n- Recognises the fair value of the \\nconsideration received \\n- Recognises the fair value of any investment \\nretained \\n- Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss \\n- Reclassifies the Holding company share of \\ncomponents previously recognised in OCI to \\nprofit or loss or retained earnings, as appropriate, \\nas would be required if the Group had directly \\ndisposed of the related assets or liabilities.\\n(c) Property, plant and equipment (PPE)\\nFreehold land is carried at historical cost. All other item of \\nproperty, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost \\nless depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that is \\ndirectly attributable to the acquisition of items.\\nCapital work-in-progress , property, plant and equipment is \\nstated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Such cost \\nincludes the cost of replacing part of the property, plant and \\nequipment if the recognition criteria are met. When significant \\nparts of property, plant and equipment are required to be \\nreplaced at intervals, The Group depreciates them separately \\nbased on thier specific useful lifes. Likewise, when a major \\ninspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the \\ncarrying amount of the property, plant and equipment as a \\nreplacement if the recongnition criteria are satisfied. All other \\nrepairs and maintenance costs are recognised in profit or \\nloss as incurred.\\nCapital work-in-progress comprises cost of property, plant \\nand equipment (including related expenses), that are not yet \\nready for their intended use at the reporting date.\\nSubsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount \\nor recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when \\nit is probable that future economic benefits associated with \\nthe item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be \\nmeasured reliably. The carrying amount of any component \\naccounted for as a separate asset is derecognised when \\nreplaced. All other repairs and maintenance are charged \\nto profit or loss during the reporting period in which \\nthey are incurred.\\n Depreciation on property, plant and equipment\\nDepreciation is provided to the extent of depreciable amount \\non written down value method (except for leasehold land \\nwhich is amortised over the period of lease) over the useful \\nlife of asset as assessed by the management and the same is \\nsimilar to the useful lives as prescribed in Part-C of Schedule \\nII to the Companies Act, 2013. Depreciation is charged on \\npro-rata basis for asset purchased / sold during the year.\\nThe assets residual values, useful life and method of \\ndepreciation of property plant & equipment are reviewed and \\nadjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.\\n(d) Business combinations and goodwill\\nThe Group has accounted business combinations using the \\nacquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured \\nas the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured \\nat acquisition date fair value. Acquisition-related costs are \\nexpensed as incurred.\\nAt the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and \\nthe liabilities assumed are recognised at their acquisition \\ndate fair values.\\nIf the business combination is achieved in stages, any \\npreviously held equity interest is re-measured at its acquisition \\ndate fair value and any resulting gain or loss is recognised in \\nprofit or loss or OCI, as appropriate.\\nGoodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the \\naggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount \\nrecognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous \\ninterest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and \\nliabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired \\nis in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the \\nGroup re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of \\nthe assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and \\nreviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be \\nrecognised at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still \\nresults in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired \\nover the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain \\nis recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity as capital \\nreserve. However, if there is no clear evidence of bargain \\npurchase, the entity recognises the gain directly in equity as \\ncapital reserve, without routing the same through OCI.\\nAfter initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less \\nany accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose \\nof impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business \\ncombination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each \\nof the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to \\nbenefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other \\nassets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.\\nA cash generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated \\nis tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when \\nthere is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the \\nrecoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than \\nits carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first\\n\\nNotes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\n189\\nAvenue Supermarts Limited | ANNUAL REPORT FY 2023-24\\nto reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to \\nthe unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata \\nbased on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. \\nAny impairment loss for goodwill is recognised in profit \\nor loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not \\nreversed in subsequent periods.\\n(e) Intangible assets\\nIntangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial \\nrecognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired \\nin a business combination is their fair value at the date of \\nacquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets \\nare carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation \\nand accumulated impairment losses.Intangible assets are \\namortised on a straight line method basis over the economic \\nuseful life estimated by the management.\\nIntangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful \\neconomic life and assessed for impairment whenever there \\nis an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. \\nThe amortisation period and the amortisation method for \\nan intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at \\nleast at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the \\nexpected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption \\nof future economic benefits embodied in the asset are \\nconsidered to modify the amortisation period or method, \\nas appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting \\nestimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets \\nwith finite lives is recognised in the statement of profit and \\nloss unless such expenditure forms part of carrying value \\nof another asset.\\nGains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible \\nasset are measured as the difference between the net \\ndisposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and \\nare recognised in the statement of profit or loss when the \\nasset is derecognised.\\n Amortisation on intangible assets\\nAmortisation is provided on straight line method over the \\nuseful life of asset as assessed by the management and the \\nsame is similar to the useful lives as prescribed in Part-C \\nof Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013. Amortisation is \\ncharged on pro-rata basis for asset purchased / sold during \\nthe year. The residual value, useful life and method of \\namortisation of intangible assets are reviewed and adjusted \\nif appropriate at the end of each reporting period\\n Estimated useful life of assets are as follows:\\n Computer Software - 5 years\\n Trademarks - 5 - 10 years\\n(f) Investment properties\\nInvestments in property that are not intended to be occupied \\nsubstantially for use by, or in the operations of the Group, have \\nbeen classified as investment property. Investment properties \\nare measured initially at its cost including transaction cost \\nand where applicable borrowing costs. Subsequent to initial \\nrecognition, investment properties are stated at cost less \\naccumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment \\nloss, if any. Subsequent cost are included in the assets \\ncarrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as \\nappropriate, only when it is probable that future economic \\nbenefits associated with the item will flow to the Group \\nand the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other \\nrepairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during \\nthe reporting period in which they are incurred.\\nThough the Group measures investment property using cost \\nbased measurement, the fair value of investment property is \\ndisclosed in the notes. Fair values are determined based on \\nan annual evaluation performed by an accredited external \\nindependent valuer applying a valuation model recommended \\nby the International Valuation Standards Committee.\\nThe Group depreciates its investment properties \\nover the useful life which is similar to that of Property, \\nPlant and Equipment.\\nInvestment properties are derecognised either when they \\nhave been disposed of or when they are permanently \\nwithdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is \\nexpected from their disposal. The difference between the \\nnet disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset \\nis recognised in profit or loss in the period of derecognition.\\n(g) Impairment of non financial assets\\nThe Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is \\nan indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication \\nexists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset \\nis required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable \\namount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an \\nasset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs \\nof disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is \\ndetermined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not \\ngenerate cash inflows that are largely independent of those \\nfrom other assets or Groups of assets. When the carrying \\namount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, \\nthe asset is considered impaired and is written down to its \\nrecoverable amount.\\nIn assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows \\nare discounted to their present value using a pre-tax\\n\\nNotes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n190\\nNotes\\ndiscount rate that reflects current market assessments of \\nthe time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. \\nIn determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market \\ntransactions are taken into account.\\nImpairment losses are recognised in the statement of profit \\nand loss, except for properties previously revalued with the \\nrevaluation surplus taken to other comprehensive income.\\nFor assets, an assessment is made at each reporting date \\nto determine whether there is an indication that previously \\nrecognised impairment losses no longer exist or have \\ndecreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates \\nthe asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously \\nrecognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has \\nbeen a change in the assumptions used to determine the \\nasset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss \\nwas recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying \\namount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, \\nnor exceed the carrying amount that would have been \\ndetermined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss \\nbeen recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is \\nrecognised in the statement of profit or loss unless the asset \\nis carried at a revalued amount, in which case, the reversal is \\ntreated as a revaluation increase.\\n(h) Leases\\nAs per IND AS 116 “Leases”, the determination of whether \\nan arrangement is (or contains) a lease is based on the \\nsubstance of the arrangement at the inception of the lease. \\nThe arrangement is, or contains, a lease if fulfilment of the \\narrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset \\nor assets and the arrangement conveys a right -of- use the \\nasset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly specified in \\nan arrangement.\\n As a lessee\\nLeases are capitalised at the commencement of the lease \\nat the inception date fair value of the leased property or, if \\nlower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. \\nLease payments are apportioned between finance charges \\nand reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a \\nconstant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the \\nliability. Finance charges are recognised in finance costs \\nin the statement of profit and loss, unless they are directly \\nattributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are \\ncapitalised in accordance with the company’s general policy \\non the borrowing costs. Contingent rentals are recognised \\nas expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.\\nA leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. \\nHowever, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group \\nwill obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset \\nis depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of \\nthe asset and the lease term.\\nLeases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards \\nof ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as \\noperating leases. Payments made under operating leases \\nare charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss on a \\nstraight-line basis over the period of the lease unless the \\npayments are structured to increase in line with expected \\ngeneral inflation to compensate for the lessor’s expected \\ninflationary cost increases.\\n Depreciation on right-of-use assets\\nDepreciation is provided on straight line method over \\nthe useful life of asset as assessed by the management. \\nDepreciation is charged on pro-rata basis for asset \\npurchased / sold during the year. The useful life of \\ndepreciation are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at \\nthe end of each reporting period.\\n As a lessor\\nLeases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all \\nthe risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are classified \\nas operating leases. Rental income from operating lease \\nis recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the \\nrelevant lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating \\nand arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying \\namount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease \\nterm on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents \\nare recognised as revenue in the period in which they are \\nearned unless the receipts are structured to increase in \\nline with expected general inflation to compensate for the \\nexpected inflationary cost increases. \\nLeases are classified as finance leases when substantially \\nall of the risks and rewards of ownership transfer from the \\nCompany to the lessee. Amounts due from lessees under \\nfinance leases are recorded as receivables at the Company’s \\nnet investment in the leases. Finance lease income is \\nallocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant \\nperiodic rate of return on the net investment outstanding in \\nrespect of the lease.\\n(i) Cash and cash equivalents\\nCash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprises \\ncash at banks and on hand and short term deposits with an \\noriginal maturity of three months or less, which are subject \\nto an insignificant risk of change in value. For the purpose \\nof consolidated financial statement of cash flow, cash and \\ncash equivalent consists of cash and short term deposits, \\nas defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts \\nas they are considered an integral part of The Group’s \\ncash management.\\n\\nNotes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\n191\\nAvenue Supermarts Limited | ANNUAL REPORT FY 2023-24\\n(j) Trade receivables\\nTrade receivables are initially measured at transaction \\nprice excluding any financing arrangements in sale \\ntransactions of the Group.\\n(k) Inventories\\nInventories are valued at lower of cost and net realizable \\nvalue. Cost of inventories, comprise costs of purchase \\nand other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their \\npresent condition and location. Cost is determined by \\nthe weighted average cost method. Costs of purchased \\ninventory are determined after deducting rebates and \\ndiscounts. Net realizable value is the estimated selling \\nprice in the ordinary course of business less the estimated \\ncosts of completion and the estimated cost necessary \\nto make the sale.\\n(l) Financial instruments\\nA Financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a \\nfinancial assets of one entity and a financial liability or equity \\ninstrument of another entity.\\n Financial asset\\n (i) Classification\\nThe Group classifies its financial assets in the following \\nmeasurement categories:\\n*  those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either \\nthrough other comprehensive income, or through the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss), and\\n* those measured at amortised cost.\\nThe classification depends on The Group’s business \\nmodel for managing the financial assets and the \\ncontractual terms of the cash flows.\\nFor assets measured at fair value, gains and losses \\nwill either be recorded in the Statement of Profit and \\nLoss or other comprehensive income. For investments \\nin debt instruments, this will depend on the business \\nmodel in which the investment is held. For investments \\nin equity instruments, this will depend on whether the \\nGroup has made an irrevocable election at the time of \\ninitial recognition to account for the equity investment \\nat fair value through other comprehensive income. \\nThe Group reclassifies debt investments when and \\nonly when its business model for managing those \\nassets changes.\\n (ii) Measurement\\nAt initial recognition, The Group measures a financial \\nasset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial \\nasset not at fair value through the Statement of \\nProfit and Loss, transaction costs that are directly \\nattributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. \\nTransaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value \\nthrough the Statement of Profit and Loss are expensed \\nin the Statement of Profit and Loss.\\nFinancial assets with embedded derivatives are \\nconsidered in their entirety when determining \\nwhether their cash flows are solely payment of \\nprincipal and interest.\\n Debt instruments:\\nSubsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on \\nThe Group’s business model for managing the asset and \\nthe cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three \\nmeasurement categories into which The Group classifies its \\ndebt instruments:\\n*  Amortised cost: A ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the \\namortised cost if both the following conditions are met:\\na) The asset is held within a business model whose \\nobjective is to hold assets for collecting contractual \\ncash flows, and\\nb) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified \\ndates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal \\nand interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.\\nThis category is the most relevant to The Group. After initial \\nmeasurement, such financial assets are subsequently \\nmeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest \\nrate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking \\ninto account any discount or premium on acquisition and \\nfees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR \\namortisation is included in finance income in the profit or \\nloss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in \\nthe profit or loss. This category generally applies to trade and \\nother receivables.\\n*  Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI): \\nA ‘debt instrument’ is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of \\nthe following criteria are met:\\na) The objective of the business model is achieved both \\nby collecting contractual cash flows and selling the \\nfinancial assets, and\\nb) The asset’s contractual cash flows represent SPPI.\\nDebt instruments included within the FVTOCI category \\nare measured initially as well as at each reporting date at \\nfair value. Fair value movements are recognised in the \\nother comprehensive income (OCI). However, The Group\\n\\nNotes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n192\\nNotes\\nrecognizes interest income, impairment losses & reversals and \\nforeign exchange gain or loss in the P&L. On derecognition \\nof the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised \\nin OCI is reclassified from the equity to P&L. Interest earned \\nwhilst holding FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest \\nincome using the EIR method.\\n*  Fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL): FVTPL is a \\nresidual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, \\nwhich does not meet the criteria for categorisation as at \\namortised cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.\\nIn addition, The Group may elect to designate a debt \\ninstrument, which otherwise meets amortised cost or \\nFVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election \\nis allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a \\nmeasurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as \\n‘accounting mismatch’). The Group has not designated any \\ndebt instrument as at FVTPL.\\nDebt instruments included within the FVTPL category are \\nmeasured at fair value with all changes recognised in the P&L.”\\n Equity instruments:\\nThe Group subsequently measures all equity investments \\nat fair value. Where The Group’s management has \\nelected to present fair value gains and losses on equity \\ninvestments in other comprehensive income, there is no \\nsubsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses \\nto the Statement of Profit and Loss. Dividends from such \\ninvestments are recognised in the Statement of Profit and \\nLoss as other income when The Group’s right to receive \\npayments is established.\\nChanges in the fair value of financial assets at fair value \\nthrough the Statement of Profit and Loss are recognised in \\nother income / other expenses in the Statement of Profit and \\nLoss. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) \\non equity investments measured at FVTOCI are not reported \\nseparately from other changes in fair value.\\n (iii) Impairment of financial assets\\nThe Group assesses on a forward looking basis \\nthe expected credit losses associated with its \\nassets carried at amortised cost and FVTOCI debt \\ninstruments. The impairment methodology applied \\ndepends on whether there has been a significant \\nincrease in credit risk.\\nFor trade receivables only, the Group applies the \\nsimplified approach permitted by Ind AS 109 Financial \\nInstruments, which requires expected lifetime losses to \\nbe recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.\\n (iv) Derecognition of financial assets\\nA financial asset is derecognised only when\\n*  The Group has transferred the rights to receive cash \\nflows from the financial asset or\\n*  retains the contractual rights to receive the \\ncash flows of the financial asset, but assumes a \\ncontractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or \\nmore recipients.\\nWhere the Group has transferred an asset, the Group \\nevaluates whether it has transferred substantially all \\nrisks and rewards of the financial asset. In such cases, \\nthe financial asset is derecognised. Where the Group \\nhas not transferred substantially all risks and rewards \\nof ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset \\nis not derecognised.\\nWhere the Group has neither transferred a financial \\nasset nor retains substantially all risks and rewards of \\nownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is \\nderecognised if the Group has not retained control of \\nthe financial asset. Where the Group retains control \\nof the financial asset, the asset is continued to be \\nrecognised to the extent of continuing involvement in \\nthe financial asset.\\n  Financial Liabilities\\n  (i) Offsetting financial instruments\\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the \\nnet amount is reported in the balance sheet \\nwhere there is a legally enforceable right to offset \\nthe recognised amounts and there is an intention \\nto settle on a net basis or realise the asset and \\nsettle the liability simultaneously. The legally \\nenforceable right must not be contingent on \\nfuture events and must be enforceable in the \\nnormal course of business and in the event of \\ndefault insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group or \\nthe counterparty.\\n  (ii) Trade and other payables\\nThese amounts represent liabilities for goods \\nand services provided to the Group prior to \\nthe end of financial year which are unpaid. \\nThe amounts are unsecured. Trade and other \\npayables are presented as current liabilities \\nunless payment is not due within 12 months \\nafter the reporting period. They are recognised \\ninitially at their fair value and subsequently \\nmeasured at amortised cost using the effective \\ninterest method.\\n\\nNotes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\n193\\nAvenue Supermarts Limited | ANNUAL REPORT FY 2023-24\\n  (iii) Borrowings and other financial liabilities\\nBorrowings and other financial liabilities are initially \\nrecognised at fair value (net of transaction costs \\nincurred). Difference between the fair value and the \\ntransaction proceeds on initiation is recognised as \\nan asset / liability based on the underlying reason \\nfor the difference. Subsequently all financial \\nliabilities are measured at amortised cost using \\nthe effective interest rate method.\\nBorrowings are removed from the balance sheet \\nwhen the obligation specified in the contract is \\ndischarged, cancelled or expired. The difference \\nbetween the carrying amount of a financial \\nliability that has been extinguished or transferred \\nto another party and the consideration paid, \\nincluding any non-cash transferred or liabilities \\nassumed, is recognised in the Statement of \\nProfit and Loss.\\nBorrowings are classified as current liabilities \\nunless The Group has an unconditional right \\nto defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 \\nmonths after the reporting period. Where there is \\na breach of a material provision of a long-term \\nloan arrangement on or before the end of the \\nreporting period with the effect that the liability \\nbecomes payable on demand on the reporting \\ndate, the entity does not classify the liability as \\ncurrent, if the lender agreed, after the reporting \\nperiod and before the approval of the financial \\nstatements for issue, not to demand payment as \\na consequence of the breach.\\n  (iv) Borrowing costs\\nGeneral and specific borrowing costs that \\nare directly attributable to the acquisition or \\nconstruction of qualifying assets are capitalised \\nduring the period of time that is required to \\ncomplete and prepare the asset for its intended \\nuse. Other borrowing costs are expensed in the \\nperiod in which they are incurred.\\nInvestment income earned on the temporary \\ninvestment of specific borrowings pending their \\nexpenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from \\nthe borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.\\nBorrowing cost consist of interest and other \\ncost that an entity incurs in connection with \\nborrowing of funds.\\n  (v)  Provisions, contingent liabilities and contigent \\nassets\\nProvisions are recognised when The Group has a \\npresent legal or constructive obligation as a result \\nof past events, it is probable that an outflow of \\nresources embodying economic benefit will be \\nrequired to settle the obligation and the amount \\ncan be reliably estimated.\\nProvisions are measured at the present value of \\nmanagement’s best estimate of the expenditure \\nrequired to settle the present obligation at the end \\nof the reporting period. The discount rate used \\nto determine the present value is a pre tax rate \\nthat reflects current market assessments of the \\ntime value of money and the risks specific to the \\nliability. The increase in the provision due to the \\npassage of time is recognised as finance cost.\\nContingent Liabilities are disclosed in respect \\nof possible obligations that arise from past \\nevents but their existence will be confirmed by \\nthe occurrence or non occurrence of one or \\nmore uncertain future events not wholly within \\nthe control of The Group or where any present \\nobligation cannot be measured in terms of future \\noutflow of resources or where a reliable estimate \\nof the obligation cannot be made.\\nA contingent asset is disclosed, where an inflow \\nof economic benefits is probable. An entity shall \\nnot recognize a contingent asset unless the \\nrecovery is virtually certain.\\n(m) Revenue Recognition\\nRevenue from operations is recognised to the extent that it \\nis probable that economic benefit will flow to the Group and \\nthe revenue can be reliably measured regardless of when the \\npayment is being made as per IND AS 115.\\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognised when \\nthe control/title of the goods or services are transferred to \\nthe customer at an amount of transaction price allocated to \\nthat performance obligation that reflects the consideration \\nto which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange \\nfor those goods or services excluding government duties \\ncollected on behalf of the Government.In determining the \\ntransaction price of goods sold and services rendered, the \\nGroup excludes the effect of any variable consideration on \\naccount of various discounts and schemes offered by the \\nGroup as a part of the Contract.\\n\\nNotes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n194\\nNotes\\nIt is the Group’s policy to sell its products to the end customers \\nwith the right of return of 7 days. Historical experience is used \\nto estimate and provide for such returns at the time of sale.\\nThe Group has generally concluded that it is the principal \\nin its revenue arrangements, except for the agency services \\nbelow, because it typically controls the goods or services \\nbefore transferring them to the customer.\\n Principal versus agent consideration\\nThe inventory of third party does not pass to the Group till \\nthe product is sold. At the time of sale of such inventory, \\nthe sales value along with the cost of inventory is disclosed \\nseprately as sale of goods on approval basis and cost of \\ngoods sold on approval basis and forms part of Revenue \\nin the Statement of Profit and Loss. Only the net revenue \\nearned i.e. margin is recorded as a part of revenue.\\n Rental income\\nRental income arising from operating lease on investment \\nproperties is accounted for on a straight line basis over \\nlease terms unless the receipts are structured to increase \\nin line with expected general inflation to compensate for the \\nexpected inflationary cost increases and is included in the \\nStatement of profit or loss due to its operating nature.\\n Interest income\\nInterest income is recognised based on time proportion basis \\nconsidering the amount outstanding and using effective \\ninterest rate applicable (EIR). Interest income is included in \\nthe Other Income in the statement of Profit and Loss.\\n(n) Retirement and other employee benefits\\n (i) Short-term obligations\\nLiabilities for wages and salaries, including \\nnon-monetary benefits that are expected to be settled \\nwholly within 12 months after the end of the period \\nin which the employees render the related service \\nare recognised in respect of employees’ services up \\nto the end of the reporting period and are measured \\nat the amounts expected to be paid when the \\nliabilities are settled.\\nRetirement benefit in the form of provident fund is a \\ndefined contribution plan. The Group has no obligation \\n, other than the contribution payable to the provident \\nfund. The Group recognises contribution payable \\nto the provident fund scheme as an expense, when \\nan employee renders the related services. If the \\nContribution payable to the scheme for service received \\nbefore the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution \\nalready paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is \\nrecognised as a liability after deducting the contribution \\nalready paid. If the contribution already paid exceeds \\nthe contribution due for services received before the \\nbalance sheet date,then excess is recognised as an \\nasset to the extent that the prepayment will lead to a \\nreduction in future payment or a cash refund.\\n ii) Other long-term employee benefit obligations\\nThe liabilities for earned leave and sick leave that are \\nnot expected to be settled wholly within 12 months \\nare measured at the present value of expected future \\npayments to be made in respect of services provided \\nby employees up to the end of the reporting period \\nusing the projected unit credit method. The benefits are \\ndiscounted using the Government Securities (G-Sec) \\nat the end of the reporting period that have terms \\napproximating to the terms of the related obligation. \\nRemeasurements as a result of experience adjustments \\nand changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised \\nin the Statement of Profit and Loss.\\nThe obligations are presented as current liabilities \\nin the balance sheet if the entity does not have an \\nunconditional right to defer settlement for at least \\ntwelve months after the reporting period, regardless of \\nwhen the actual settlement is expected to occur.\\n iii) Post-employment obligations\\n  Defined benefit plans\\n  Gratuity\\nThe liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet \\nin respect of defined benefit gratuity plans is the \\npresent value of the defined benefit obligation at the \\nend of the reporting period less the fair value of plan \\nassets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated \\nannually by independent actuary using the projected \\nunit credit method. The present value of the defined \\nbenefit obligation denominated in INR is determined \\nby discounting the estimated future cash outflows by \\nreference to market yields at the end of the reporting \\nperiod on government bonds that have terms \\napproximating to the terms of the related obligation.\\nThe net interest cost is calculated by applying the \\ndiscount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit \\nobligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is \\nincluded in employee benefit expense in the Statement \\nof Profit and Loss. Remeasurement gains and losses \\narising from experience adjustments and changes in \\nactuarial assumptions are recognised in the period \\nin which they occur, directly in other comprehensive \\nincome. They are included in retained earnings in the \\nstatement of changes in equity and in the balance \\nsheet.

The impact of the revision of the \\noriginal estimates, if any is , recongised in Statement \\nof Profit and Loss such that the cumulative expenses \\nreflects the revised estimate,with a corresponding \\nadjustment to the shared option outstanding account.\\nNo expense is recognised for options that do not \\nultimately vest because non market performance \\nand/or service conditions have not been met.\\nThe dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as \\nadditional share dilution in the computation of diluted \\nearnings per share.\\nExpense relating to options granted to employees of the \\nsubsidiaries under The Group’s share based payment \\nplan, is recovered from the subsidiary. Such recovery is \\nreduced from employee benefit expense.\\n(o) Foreign currency transactions\\n (a) Functional and presentation currency:\\nItems included in the financial statements of The \\nGroup are measured using the currency of the primary \\neconomic environment in which the entity operates. \\nThe Consolidated Financial statements are presented \\nin INR, which is functional and presentational currency.\\n (b) Transaction and balances :\\nTransaction in currencies other than than entity’s \\nfunctional currency (foreign currencies) are recognised \\nat the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of \\nthe transaction.\\nExchange differences arising on settlement or \\ntranslation of monetary items are recognised in the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss.\\nNon monetary items carried at fair value that are \\ndenominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at \\nthe rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was \\ndetermined. Non-monetary items that are measured in \\nterms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not \\nretransalated. The gain or loss arising on translation of \\nnon-monetary items measured at fair value is treated \\nin line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the \\nchange in fair value of the item.\\n(p) Income Tax\\n a) Current Tax\\nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities are measured \\nat the amount expected to be recovered from or paid \\nto the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws \\nused to compute the amount are those that enacted \\nor substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the \\ncountries where the Group operates and generates \\ntaxable income.\\n b) Deferred tax\\nDeferred income tax is provided using the liability \\nmethod on temporary differences arising between the \\ntax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying \\namount for financial reporting purpose at the reporting \\ndate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined \\nusing tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or \\nsubstantially enacted by the end of the reporting period \\nand are expected to apply when the asset is realised or \\nthe liability is settled.\\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible \\ntemporary differences and unused tax losses, only if, it \\nis probable that future taxable amounts will be available \\nto utilise those temporary differences and losses.\\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there \\nis a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets \\nand liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate \\nto the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and \\ntax liabilities are off set where the Group has a legally \\nenforceable right to offset and intends either to settle \\non a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the \\nliability simultaneously.\\nCurrent and deferred tax is recognised in the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss, except to the extent that \\nit relates to items recognised in other comprehensive \\nincome or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also \\nrecognised in other comprehensive income or directly \\nin equity, respectively.\\n\\nNotes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n196\\nNotes\\n(q) Earnings Per Share\\n Basic earnings per share\\n Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing:\\n- the profit attributable to equity shareholder of the Group\\n- by the weighted average number of equity shares \\noutstanding during the financial year\\n Diluted earnings per share\\nDiluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the \\ndetermination of basic earnings per share to take into account:\\n- the after income tax effect of interest and other \\nfinancing costs associated with dilutive potential \\nequity shares, and\\n- the weighted average number of additional equity \\nshares that would have been outstanding assuming \\nthe conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.\\n(r) Fair value measurement\\nThe Group measures financial instrument at fair value at \\neach Balance sheet date.\\nFair value is the price that would received to sell an assets or \\npaid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between \\nmarket participant at the measurment date.\\nThe fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are \\nincluded at the amount at which the instrument could be \\nexchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, \\nother than in a forced or liquidation sale.\\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to \\nestimate the fair values:\\n1. Fair value of cash and deposits, trade and other \\nreceivables, trade payables, other current liabilities, \\napproximate their carrying amounts largely due to short \\nterm maturities of these instruments.\\n2. For financial assets and liabilities that are measured \\nat fair value, the carrying amounts are equal to \\nthe fair values.\\nThe Group uses the following hierarchy for determining \\nand disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by \\nvaluation technique:\\nLevel 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for \\nidentical assets or liabilities.\\nLevel 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a \\nsignificant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, \\neither directly or indirectly.\\nLevel 3: techniques which use inputs that have a significant \\neffect on the recorded fair value that are not based on \\nobservable market data.\\n(s)  Significant accounting judgement, estimates and \\nassumption\\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires \\nthe use of accounting estimates which by definition will seldom \\nequal the actual results. Management also need to exercise \\njudgement in applying The Group’s accounting policies.\\n Share based payment\\nThe Group initially measures the cost of equity settled \\ntransaction with employees using Black Scholes model \\nto determine the fair value of the liability incurred. \\nEstimating fair value for share-based payment transacton \\nrequires determination of the most appropriate valuation \\nmodel, which is dependent on the terms and conditions \\nof the grant. The estimates also requires determination \\nof the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model \\nincluding expected life of the share option, volatility and \\ndividend yield and making assumptions about them.For \\nequity settled share based payment transaction, the liability \\nneeds to be re-measured at the end of each reporting \\nperiod upto the date of settlement, with any changes in \\nfair value recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. \\nThis requires a re-assessment of the estimates used at \\nend of each reporting period. The assumption and models \\nused for estimating the fair value for share based-payment \\ntransaction are disclosed in note no 45.\\n Provision for inventory\\nThe Group has calculated the provision for inventory basis \\nthe percentage as per historical experience for inventory \\nlying from the last inventory count date to the reporting date.\\nAn inventory provision is also recognised for cases where the \\nrealisable value is estimated to be lower than the inventory \\ncarrying value. The inventory provision is estimated taking \\ninto account various factors, including prevailing sales \\nprices of inventory item, the seasonality of the item’s sales \\nprofile and losses associated with obsolete / slow-moving \\ninventory items.\\n Defined benefit plans (gratuity benefits)\\nThe cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and other \\npost-employment medical benefits and the present value \\nof the gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial\\n\\nNotes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\n197\\nAvenue Supermarts Limited | ANNUAL REPORT FY 2023-24\\nvaluations. An actuarial valuation involves making various \\nassumptions that may differ from actual developments in \\nthe future. These include the determination of the discount \\nrate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the \\ncomplexities involved in the valuation and its long-term \\nnature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to \\nchanges in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed \\nat each reporting date.\\nThe parameter most subject to change is the discount \\nrate. In determining the appropriate discount rate for plans \\noperated in India, the management considers the interest \\nrates of government bonds in currencies consistent with the \\ncurrencies of the post-employment benefit obligation.\\nThe mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality \\ntables for the specific countries. Those mortality tables \\ntend to change only at interval in response to demographic \\nchanges. Future salary increases and gratuity increases are \\nbased on expected future inflation rates.\\nFurther details about gratuity obligations are given in note \\nno: 46.\\n(t) Segment reporting\\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with \\nthe internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision \\nmaker being Managing Director of The Group . The Managing \\nDirector assesses the financial performance and position of \\nThe Group as a whole, and makes strategic decisions.\\n(u) Cash flow\\nThe investing and financing activities in cash flow statement \\ndo not have a direct impact on current cash flows although \\nthey do affect the capital and asset structure of an entity. \\nThe Group has disclosed these transactions, to the extent \\nmaterial, in notes to consolidated cash flow statement.\\n\\nNotes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\n2 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\\n(` in Crores)\\nFreehold land \\n(Refer note : \\n2,6,7)\\nBuildings \\n(Refer \\nnote : \\n1,4,5)\\nLeasehold \\nimprovement\\nPlant and \\nequipment\\nComputers Furniture \\nand \\nfixtures\\nVehicles Office \\nequipment\\nElectrical \\ninstallations\\nTotal\\nCost\\nBalance as at \\n1st April, 2022\\n 3,691.13  3,942.02  107.78  462.67  152.61  443.39  3.44  73.31  328.99  9,205.34 \\nAdditions  877.77  1,087.40  24.22  162.48  40.41  104.42  13.47  12.47  99.74  2,422.38 \\nDisposals  -    0.54  3.13  10.44  2.88  5.95  2.13  1.25  2.69  29.01 \\nBalance as at \\n31st March, 2023\\n 4,568.90  5,028.88  128.87  614.71  190.14  541.86  14.78  84.53  426.04  11,598.71 \\nAdditions  1,274.82  774.29  11.64  214.67  33.98  126.70  3.42  17.59  121.61  2,578.72 \\nDisposals  -    0.02  7.71  8.03  4.99  7.72  0.88  5.58  3.34  38.27 \\nBalance as at \\n31st March, 2024\\n 5,843.72  5,803.15  132.80  821.35  219.13  660.84  17.32  96.54  544.31  14,139.16 \\nDepreciation\\nBalance as at \\n1st April, 2022\\n -    652.01  63.25  181.76  110.66  214.30  2.54  42.74  167.62  1,434.88 \\nCharge for the \\nyear\\n -    184.72  22.54  73.55  31.57  73.24  10.77  9.06  54.14  459.59 \\nDisposals  -    0.17  1.61  8.47  2.65  4.17  1.66  1.10  1.54  21.37 \\nBalance as at \\n31st March, 2023\\n -    836.56  84.18  246.84  139.58  283.37  11.65  50.70  220.22  1,873.10 \\nCharge for the \\nyear\\n -    224.96  16.76  94.38  33.16  79.73  8.52  10.29  65.85  533.65 \\nDisposals  -    0.01  4.65  6.33  4.58  5.05  3.82  0.79  1.55  26.78 \\nBalance as at \\n31st March, 2024\\n -    1,061.51  96.29  334.89  168.16  358.05  16.35  60.20  284.52  2,379.97 \\nNet book value\\nBalance as at \\n31st March, 2023\\n 4,568.90  4,192.32  44.69  367.87  50.56  258.49  3.13  33.83  205.82  9,725.61 \\nBalance as at \\n31st March, 2024\\n 5,843.72  4,741.64  36.51  486.46  50.97  302.79  0.97  36.34  259.79  11,759.19 \\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n198\\nNotes\\n\\nNotes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\nNote:\\n1 Building includes following amounts for construction under built operate and transfer (BOT) arrangement .\\n(` in Crores)\\nParticulars As at  \\n31st March, 2024\\nAs at  \\n31st March, 2023\\nOpening Balance   45.24  40.98 \\nAddition during the year  1.02  4.26 \\nGross block  46.26  45.24 \\nNet block  31.28  31.89 \\n2 Freehold land includes ` 699.73 Crores (31 st March, 2023 : ` 595.76 Crores) being  property purchased, for which mutation is pending.\\n3 Details of Capital work in progress -\\n(` in Crores)\\nParticulars As at  \\n31st March, 2024\\nAs at  \\n31st March, 2023\\nOpening Balance  829.16  1,129.34 \\nAdditions during the year  1,143.46  1,089.06 \\nTransfer during the year  (1,037.40)  (1,389.24)\\nClosing Balance  935.22  829.16 \\n a) Capital work in progress ageing schedule\\n(` in Crores)\\nParticulars Less than 1 year 1- 2  years 2- 3  years more than 3 \\nyears\\nTotal\\nProject in progress  598.93  106.96  207.74  21.59  935.22 \\nProject temporarily suspended  -    -    -    -    -   \\nBalance as at 31 st March, 2024  598.93  106.96  207.74  21.59  935.22 \\nProject in progress  450.27  290.84  36.37  51.68  829.16 \\nProject temporarily suspended  -    -    -    -    -   \\nBalance as at 31 st March, 2023  450.27  290.84  36.37  51.68  829.16 \\nb) All the upcoming projects of the Group are within the timelines as estimated during the original plan and the actual cost of projects are within \\nthe total cost as estimated by the management of the Group as on 31 st March, 2024.\\n4 No assets are pledged as security for borrowings.\\n5 Building includes Net book value of plant and equipment fitting of ` 14.00 Crores (31 st March, 2023 : ` 17.56 Crores).\\n6 Freehold Land includes one property at Bhamti Nagar, Nagpur of ` 10.65 crores as at 31 st March, 2024 (31 st March, 2023: ` 10.65 crores) \\npurchased by the Holding Company.

Rate will increase the present value of the liability \\nrequiring higher provision. A fall in the discount rate generally increases the mark to market value of the assets depending on \\nthe duration of asset.\\nSalary risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of members. \\nAs such, an increase in the salary of the members more than assumed level will increase the plan’s liability.\\nInvestment risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined \\nby reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds. If the return on plan asset is below this \\nrate, it will create a plan deficit. Currently, for the plan in India, it has a relatively balanced mix of investments in government \\nsecurities and other debt instruments.\\nAsset liability matching risk: The plan faces the ALM risk as to the matching cash flow. Since the plan is invested in lines of \\nRule 101 of Income Tax Rules, 1962, this generally reduces ALM risk.\\nMortality risk: Since the benefits under the plan is not payable for life time and payable till retirement age only, plan does not \\nhave any longevity risk.\\nConcentration risk: Plan is having a concentration risk as all the assets are invested with the insurance companies\\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n226\\nNotes\\n\\nNotes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\n47   FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\\n Financial risk management objectives and policies\\nThe Group’s financial principal liabilities comprises  lease liability, trade payables and other payables.

The Company \\napplied for the first-time these amendments.\\n (i)  Definition of Accounting Estimates - Amendments to Ind AS 8\\nThe amendments clarify the distinction between changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies and the \\ncorrection of errors. It has also been clarified how entities use measurement techniques and inputs to develop accounting estimates.  \\nThe amendments had no impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.\\n (ii) Disclosure of Accounting Policies - Amendments to Ind AS 1\\nThe amendments aim to help entities provide accounting policy disclosures that are more useful by replacing the requirement \\nfor entities to disclose their ‘significant’ accounting policies with a requirement to disclose their ‘material’ accounting policies \\nand adding guidance on how entities apply the concept of materiality in making decisions about accounting policy disclosures.  \\nThe amendments have had an impact on the Group’s disclosures of accounting policies, but not on the measurement, \\nrecognition or presentation of any items in the Group’s financial statements.\\n (iii) Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction - Amendments to Ind AS 12\\nThe amendments narrow the scope of the initial recognition exception under Ind AS 12, so that it no longer applies to \\ntransactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences such as leases.\\nThe Group previously recognised for deferred tax on leases on a net basis. As a result of these amendments, the Group has \\nrecognised a separate deferred tax asset in relation to its lease liabilities and a deferred tax liability in relation to its right-of-use \\nassets. Since, these balances qualify for offset as per the requirements of paragraph 74 of Ind AS 12,there is no impact in the \\nbalance sheet. There was also no impact on the opening retained earnings as at 1 st April, 2023.\\n51 STANDARDS NOTIFIED BUT NOT EFFECTIVE\\nThere are no standards that are notified and not yet effective as on the date.\\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\\nSTATUTORY REPORTS\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTICE OF THE AGM\\n230\\nNotes\\n\\nNotes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\\n52 SHAREHOLDING OF PROMOTERS     \\n As at 31 st March, 2024\\nPromoter Name No of shares at \\nthe beginning \\nof the year\\nChange during \\nthe year\\nNo of shares at \\nthe end of the \\nyear\\n% of total \\nshares\\n% change \\nduring the year\\n1.

      "### Financial Risks:\n",
      "1. **Cybersecurity**: Breaches in cybersecurity could disrupt business operations, leading to financial losses.\n",
      "2. **Pandemic Impact**: Outbreaks of new COVID-19 variants or other pandemics could materially affect business operations and financial condition.\n",
      "3. **Climate Change**: Potential impacts of climate change may lead to lower sales, reduced profits, and increased compliance costs due to changing regulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Market Risks:\n",
      "1. **Consumer Preferences**: The need to understand and predict changing consumer needs and preferences to customize offerings effectively.\n",

H1 began on a promising \\nnote with sales volumes increasing \\nacross most segments. However, the \\ncombined effects of a high base, state \\nelections and the upcoming general \\nelections moderated growth in H2. \\nLed by the government’s thrust on \\ninfrastructure building and increased \\nactivity in e ‑commerce, construction \\nand people mobility, the industry saw \\nsustained demand for heavy trucks \\nand passenger carriers through the \\nyear, resulting in sales growing by 3% \\nand 28%, respectively. Overall, the \\nCV industry grew by a modest 2% as \\ndemand in the ILMCV, SCV cargo and \\npickup segments shrunk, bringing to \\nfore the cyclical nature of our industry.\\nThe realignment of our CV business \\ninto eight business verticals matured \\nduring the year with enhanced financial \\nfocus.

A sharper focus on profitable \\ngrowth resulted in highest ever \\nEBIT (of I 6,479 crore) growing by a \\nhealthy 77% over FY23. Building on \\nthese results, we will continue with \\nour efforts to achieve a more resilient \\nand optimised business structure. \\nConcurrently, we will strive to grow \\nmarket share profitably across product \\nsegments by consistently delivering \\ncustomer value through innovative \\nproducts and value ‑added services.\\nWe launched 140+ products and 700+ \\nvariants for passenger and cargo \\ntransportation to fulfil the growing \\ndemand for safer, smarter, and greener \\nmobility solutions. We deployed \\n1,100+ E‑buses under the CESL tender \\nalong with 12 fully equipped depots; \\nramped up Ace EV retails multifold; \\nintroduced fuel cell electric buses in \\npartnership with IOCL; and initiated \\nthe real‑world deployment of electric \\nheavy trucks to Tata Steel's fleet. \\nDuring the year, we won several \\nprestigious awards acknowledging the \\nexcellence of our products, services, \\nsolutions, initiatives, and people. \\nAs part of the digital marketing \\napproach, key initiatives were \\nimplemented, considering product, \\nregion, and language variables, \\nwith an aim to maximise reach and \\nefficiency.

The first half started optimistically \\nwith a surge in sales volumes across most business segments. \\nHowever, the second half saw a moderation in growth due \\nto the combined impact of a high base, elections in five \\nstates and impending general elections.

We have set \\nourselves ambitious targets \\nof achieving Net Zero GHG \\nemissions by 2045 in CV \\nbusiness and 2040 in the \\nPV business.

Environmental \\nregulations \\nand compliance\\nRisk We are subject to a rapidly \\nevolving regulatory \\nlandscape with associated \\nlaws, regulations and \\npolicies that impact our \\nfacilities and vehicles. \\nThe transition away from \\ntraditional fossil fuels to \\nrenewable energy sources  \\nand the increasing pace \\nof that transition creates \\ncompliance challenges. \\nNotable to mention here \\nare tailpipe emissions for \\nautomotive companies \\nand wider compliance \\nrequirements for carbon \\nemissions produced \\nduring manufacturing and \\nother operations.\\nTML is ahead of the curve \\nin meeting environment \\nregulations and \\ncompliance as we view \\nevery regulatory norm \\nchange as an opportunity \\nto add significant value \\nto our products while \\nmeeting our stakeholder’s \\naspirations. e.g. In the BS4 \\nto BS6 transition, we have \\ncapitalised by refreshing \\nour entire portfolio with \\nsignificant product upgrades \\nthat add immense value \\nthroughout the product \\nlife-cycle.\\nWe may incur additional \\ncompliance costs to avoid \\nfacing significant civil and \\nregulatory penalties and \\nour competitors may gain \\nan advantage by adopting \\nnew emissions-reducing and \\nfuel-efficient technologies \\nbefore we do. Furthermore, \\nwe may incur significant \\nreputational damage, which \\ncould materially impact \\nour brands and sales, if we \\nfail to meet environmental \\ncompliances. Regulatory \\nand governmental policy \\nchanges may introduce \\nadditional operational costs \\nin the form of carbon pricing \\nand taxation.\\n3. Supply Chain \\nSustainability\\nRisk and \\nOpportunity\\nConsumers are increasingly \\ninterested in the \\nsustainability of products \\nthey purchase, including the \\nenvironmental and social \\nimpacts of the entire supply \\nchain. Non-compliance \\nof the supply chain with \\nenvironmental, labour \\nand ethical standards \\ncan lead to reputational \\ndamage, legal liabilities and \\noperational disruptions.\\nWe are dedicated to leading \\nthe way in Sustainable \\nMobility, with a focus on \\nour supply chain. Initiatives \\nlike the ‘Sustainable \\nSupply Chain Initiative’ \\n(launched in 2017) and \\n‘AIKYAM’ a collaborative \\nplatform (introduced in \\n2023) underscore this \\ncommitment. We have \\nestablished a robust \\nframework including a \\nSupplier Code of Conduct, \\nEnvironmental Procurement \\nPolicy and Sustainability \\nGuidelines covering \\ngovernance, compliance, \\ntransparency, safety and \\nhuman rights. Oversight \\nmechanisms, led by the \\nExecutive Committee and \\nChief Purchasing Officer, \\nensure effective execution. \\nContinuous review of \\nprocurement practices \\nmaintains alignment with \\nsustainability goals.\\nDependence on \\nunsustainable suppliers may \\ndisrupt operations and harm \\nproduct quality.

Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? If Yes, what percentage of inputs were \\nsourced sustainably?\\n TML is committed to a significant shift, aiming to position itself as a frontrunner in Sustainable Mobility. Recognizing the \\npivotal role of the supply chain in this transition, TML launched the ‘Sustainable Supply Chain Initiative’ back in 2017 and a \\ncollaborative platform called ‘AIKYAM’ in 2023.\\n Within this endeavor, we’ve established a comprehensive framework comprising a Supplier Code of Conduct, an \\nEnvironmental Procurement Policy and Sustainability Guidelines for Suppliers. These guidelines encompass critical aspects \\nsuch as governance, legal compliance, management system certification, transparency and reporting, occupational health \\nand safety, labour, rights and human rights. Our objective in setting these standards is to nurture responsible practices \\namong our suppliers and partners alike.\\n In tandem with these foundational guidelines, we’ve instituted robust oversight mechanisms to ensure the effective \\nexecution of our supplier ESG program. Oversight responsibility is clearly defined, with the highest decision-making body, \\nthe Executive Committee Members, along with the Chief Purchasing Officer, tasked with monitoring and guiding this \\npivotal aspect of our sustainability journey.\\n Moreover, our procurement practices undergo continuous review to maintain alignment with the Supplier Code of Conduct \\nand prevent any potential conflicts with our ESG requirements. This ongoing scrutiny ensures that every aspect of our \\nprocurement process resonates with our sustainability objectives.\\n In addition to these efforts, we actively evaluate our suppliers against minimum ESG requirements. Through rigorous \\nassessments, we gauge their adherence to sustainability standards, thereby gaining valuable insights into their environmental \\nand social performance. Recognizing the indispensable role of internal stakeholders, comprehensive training is imparted \\nto our company’s buyers and relevant personnel. We pursued this initiative downstream in 2019, wherein the Dealer Code \\nof Conduct and the Dealer Sustainability Guidelines were developed to guide dealerships to improve their sustainability \\npractices, along with assessments of their ESG performance through assessment questionnaires.\\n In FY 2023-24, we conducted assessments for 836 supply chain partners and franchise outlets across Commerical Vehicle, \\nPassenger Vehicle and Electric Vehicle business.\\n3. Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for \\n(a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) Other waste.\\n Products post-consumer waste:\\n As a part of end-of-life product management, we are continuously working on improving our product’s circularity. It \\ninvolves designing the vehicle for recyclability, selection of sustainable materials by studying their environmental impact, \\ndesigning vehicle assemblies / components that are easy to dismantle and providing information about the same in our \\nproducts, etc.\\n Design for recycling approach complements our initiative on circular economy, which aims to minimize waste and reduce \\nthe negative impact. During design stage, TML has been encouraging use of recyclable materials in the products and is \\nactively working towards improving the product recyclability. Typically, all vehicles are designed to achieve minimum 85% \\nrecyclability and 90% recoverability.\\n At the end of the product lifecycle, scrapping and recycling of vehicles in a responsible way supports environmental goals. \\nTML demonstrated its holistic commitment towards sustainable mobility with the launch of “Re.Wi.Re – Recycle with \\nRespect” to facilitate the safe recycling of End-of-life Vehicles (ELV). The state-of-the-art TML Re.Wi.Re. facility is designed \\nto dismantle end-of-life passenger and commercial vehicles of all brands. These facilities will drive responsible scrapping \\nand recycling of end-of-life vehicles by using globally benchmarked and optimized processes. With the launch of Re.Wi.Re., \\nTML aims to offer better value capture in downstream businesses, generate employment and support the minimization \\n177\\nSTANDALONE \\nFINANCIALS 383INTEGRATED  \\nREPORT 4 STATUTORY  \\nREPORTS 132 CONSOLIDATED \\nFINANCIALS\\n262'),\n",

Specifically, we ensure the sale of all \\nflexible and rigid plastic packaging to authorized plastic waste processors for re-cycling and utilization in manufacture \\nof new packaging material. Hazardous and Other Waste are similarly routed to authorized re-cyclers or re-processors \\nfor material recovery or to co-processing for energy recovery through cement plants. We also ensure safe disposal of \\nspecific hazardous wastes as mandated in operating Consent/Authorizations, through Government authorized Treatment \\nStorage and Disposal Facilities. E-wastes from our Operations, comprising of electronic devices, their components and IT \\nassets that are discarded after their useful life or due to obsolescence, are disposed only to authorized re-cyclers.

Is the premise / office of the entity accessible to differently abled visitors, as per the requirements of the Rights of \\nPersons with Disabilities Act, 2016?\\n In an era where inclusivity is not just a buzzword but a fundamental aspect of societal progress, ensuring accessibility for \\ndifferently abled individuals within office premises has become a crucial endeavor. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities \\n(RPWD) Act, 2016, in India serves as a guiding light, mandating measures to ensure equal opportunities and access for \\npeople with disabilities. As we strive to adhere to these regulations, they are presented with various strategies to enhance \\npremise and office accessibility, especially in locations that pose unique challenges.\\n i. Understanding the Landscape: TML is based out of from diverse locations, ranging from modern commercial spaces to \\nheritage buildings with historical significance. Each setting presents its own set of challenges and opportunities in terms \\nof accessibility. While some commercial locations may already boast inclusive premises due to modern construction \\nnorms or proactive measures, older buildings may require significant retrofitting to meet accessibility standards.\\n ii. Assessing the Need: To embark on the journey of creating inclusive premises, we are kick starting comprehensive \\naccessibility audits. These audits serve as invaluable tools in identifying barriers to accessibility and prioritizing areas \\nfor improvement. By mapping out the current state of accessibility, we are developing a clear roadmap for action, \\nensuring that resources are allocated effectively and efficiently.\\n iii.  Implementing Solutions: Once the audit process is complete, we can begin implementing measures to enhance \\naccessibility. These measures may include:\\n  a. Physical Modifications:  Retrofitting entrances with ramps, widening doorways, installing handrails and ensuring \\naccessible restroom facilities are just a few examples of physical modifications that can greatly improve \\naccessibility for differently abled individuals.\\n  b.  Technological Solutions: We would also leverage technology can also play a significant role in enhancing \\naccessibility. From automated doors and elevators to assistive devices such as screen readers and braille \\ndisplays, technology can bridge gaps and empower individuals with disabilities to navigate office spaces \\nmore independently.\\n  c. Training and Sensitization: It’s not just about physical infrastructure; fostering a culture of inclusivity within \\nthe organization is equally important. Providing training and sensitization sessions for employees promotes \\nawareness and understanding of the challenges faced by differently abled individuals, fostering a more inclusive \\nwork environment.\\n  d. Collaboration and Partnerships:  We are also leveraging collaborations and partnerships with disability rights \\norganizations, accessibility experts and government agencies to gain insights and support in their journey \\ntowards creating inclusive premises.\\n79th Integrated Annual Report\\n2023-24\\n194'),\n",

The Company also manufactures engines for \\nindustrial applications, aggregates such as axles and \\ntransmissions for commercial vehicles and factory \\nautomation equipment, and provides information \\ntechnology services.\\n Tata Motors Limited is a public limited company \\nincorporated and domiciled in India and has its \\nregistered office at Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. As at \\nMarch 31, 2024, Tata Sons Private Limited, together with \\nits subsidiaries and joint venture owns 46.29% of the \\nOrdinary shares and 7.66% of ‘A’ Ordinary shares of the \\nCompany and has the ability to significantly influence \\nthe Company’s operation.\\n The Company’s subsidiaries includes the Jaguar Land \\nRover business (referred to as JLR or Jaguar Land Rover).\\n The consolidated financial statements were approved by \\nthe Board of Directors and authorised for issue on May \\n10, 2024.\\n2. Material accounting policies\\n (a) Statement of compliance\\n  These financial statements have been prepared \\nin accordance with Ind AS as notified under the \\nCompanies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, \\n2015 read with Section 133 of the Companies Act, \\n2013 (“the Act”) as amended from time to time.\\n (b) Basis of preparation\\n  The consolidated financial statements have \\nbeen prepared on historical cost basis except for \\ncertain financial instruments which are measured \\nat fair value at the end of each reporting period \\nas explained in the accounting policies below. \\nThese consolidated financial statements are \\npresented in Indian Rupees (INR), which is also \\nthe Company’s functional currency. All amounts \\nhave been rounded to the nearest crores, unless \\notherwise indicated.\\n (c) Basis of consolidation\\n  Subsidiaries\\n  The consolidated financial statements include Tata \\nMotors Limited and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries \\nare entities controlled by the Company. Control \\nexists when the Company (a) has power over \\nthe investee, (b) it is exposed, or has rights, to \\nvariable returns from its involvement with the \\ninvestee and (c) has the ability to affect those \\nreturns through its power to direct relevant \\nactivities of the investee. Relevant activities are \\nthose activities that significantly affect an entity’s \\nreturns. The Company reassesses whether or not \\nit controls an investee if facts and circumstances \\nindicate that there are changes to one or more \\nof the three elements listed above. In assessing \\ncontrol, potential voting rights that currently are \\nexercisable and other contractual arrangements \\nthat may influence control are taken into account. \\nThe results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of \\nduring the year are included in the consolidated \\nfinancial statements from the effective date of \\nacquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, \\nas appropriate.\\n  Inter-company transactions and balances \\nincluding unrealised profits are eliminated in full \\non consolidation.\\n  Non-controlling interests in the net assets \\n(excluding goodwill) of consolidated subsidiaries \\nare identified separately from the Company’s \\nequity. The interest of non-controlling shareholders \\nmay be initially measured either at fair value or \\nat the non-controlling interests’ proportionate \\nshare of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable \\nnet assets. The choice of measurement basis \\nis made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. \\nSubsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount \\nof non-controlling interests is the amount of \\nthose interests at initial recognition plus the non-\\ncontrolling interests’ share of subsequent changes \\nin equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed \\nto non-controlling interests even if it results in the \\nnon-controlling interest having a deficit balance. \\nChanges in the Company’s interests in subsidiaries \\nthat do not result in a loss of control are accounted \\nfor as equity transactions. The carrying amount of \\nthe Company’s interests and the non-controlling \\ninterests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their \\nrelative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference \\nbetween the amount by which the non-controlling \\ninterests are adjusted and the fair value of the \\nconsideration paid or received is recognised directly \\nin equity and attributed to owners of the Company. \\nWhen the Company loses control of a subsidiary, \\nthe profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the \\ndifference between (i) the aggregate of the fair \\nvalue of consideration received and the fair value of \\nany retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying \\namount of the assets (including goodwill), and \\nliabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling \\ninterests. Amounts previously recognised in other \\ncomprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary \\nare accounted for (i.e., reclassified to profit or \\nloss) in the same manner as would be required if \\nthe relevant assets or liabilities were disposed of. \\nThe fair value of any investment retained in the \\nformer subsidiary at the date when control is lost \\nis regarded as the fair value on initial recognition \\n79th Integrated Annual Report\\n2023-24\\n284'),\n",

In developing these forecasts, the Company \\nand JLR have modelled a base case. The base case \\nuses the most recent Board-approved forecasts \\nthat include the going concern assessment period; \\na steady improvement in wholesale volumes, with \\nassociated increases in EBIT in the going concern \\nassessment period compared to the previous \\n12 months reflecting the removal of supply and \\nproduction constraints that existed in previous \\nperiods and eased over the course of the year \\nended March 31, 2024.\\n  For the Company, the base case has been further \\nsensitized using more severe but plausible scenarios \\nconsidering external market commentaries and \\nother factors impacting the global economy and \\nautomotive industry.\\n  JLR has carried out a reverse stress test against the \\nbase case to determine the decline in wholesale \\nvolumes over a twelve-month period that would \\nresult in a liquidity level that breaches the GBP 1 \\nbillion liquidity financing covenant. The reverse \\nstress test assumes optimisation of production to \\nmaximise production of higher margin products. \\nIn order to reach a liquidity level that breaches \\ncovenants, it would require a sustained decline in \\nwholesale volumes of 62% compared to the base \\ncase over a 12-month period. The reverse stress \\ntest reflects the variable profit impact of the \\nwholesale volume decline, and assumes all other \\nassumptions are held in line with the base case. It \\ndoes not reflect other potential upside measures \\nthat could be taken in such a reduced volume \\nscenario; nor any new funding.\\n  JLR does not consider this scenario to be plausible \\ngiven that the stress test volumes are significantly \\nlower than the volumes achieved during both the \\npeak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the worst \\nquarter of semiconductor shortages. JLR has a \\nstrong order bank and is confident that it can \\nsignificantly exceed reverse stress test volumes.\\n  JLR has also considered the impact of severe but \\nplausible downside scenarios, including scenarios \\nthat reflect a decrease in variable profit per unit \\ncompared with the base case to include additional \\nincreases in material and other related production \\ncosts. The expected wholesale volumes under all of \\nthese scenarios are higher than under the reverse \\nstress test.\\n  Based on the evaluation described above, \\nmanagement believes that the Company and JLR \\nhave sufficient financial resources available to it at \\nthe date of approval of these financial statements \\nand that it will be able to continue as a ‘going \\nconcern’ in the foreseeable future and for a period \\nupto at least twelve months from the date of \\nauthorisation of these financial statement.\\n (f) Use of estimates and judgements\\n  The preparation of financial statements in \\nconformity with Ind AS requires management to \\nmake judgments, estimates and assumptions, that \\naffect the application of accounting policies and \\nthe reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, \\nexpenses and disclosures of contingent assets and \\nliabilities at the date of these financial statements \\nand the reported amounts of revenues and \\nexpenses for the years presented. Actual results \\nmay differ from these estimates and judgements.\\n  Estimates\\n  Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed \\nat each balance sheet date. Revisions to accounting \\nestimates are recognised in the period in which the \\nestimate is revised and in future periods affected. \\nIn particular, information about significant areas \\nof estimation uncertainty and critical judgments \\nin applying accounting policies that have the \\nmost significant effect on the amounts recognised \\nin the financial statements are included in the \\nfollowing notes:\\n  i) Note 3, 6 and 7 - Property, plant and \\nequipment and intangible assets – Useful lives \\nand impairment\\n  ii) Note 5 - Impairment of goodwill\\n  iii) Note 22 - Recoverability/recognition of \\ndeferred tax assets\\n  iv) Note 31 - Provision for product warranty\\n  v) Note 36 - Assets and obligations relating to \\nemployee benefits\\n  vi) Note 18 - Allowances for credit losses for \\nfinance receivables\\n  vii) Estimated discounts / incentives required to \\nbe paid to dealers on retail of vehicles\\n  viii) Note 2(e) – Going concern assessment\\n  Judgements\\n  i) Revenue recognition: The Company uses \\njudgement to determine when control of its \\ngoods, primarily vehicles and parts, pass to \\nthe customer.

Right of use assets\\n (a)  Accounting policy\\n  Lessee:\\n  At inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether a contract is, or contain a lease. A contract is,or contains, \\na lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for \\nconsideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company \\nassesses whether:\\n  • The contract involves the use of an identified asset – this may be specified explicitly or implicitly, and should be \\nphysically distinct or represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically distinct asset. If the supplier has a \\nsubstantive substation right, then the asset is not identified;\\n  • The Company has the right to substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the \\nperiod of use; and\\n  • The Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. The Company has this right when it has the decision \\nmaking rights that are most relevant to changing how and for what purposes the asset is used.\\n  • In rare cases where the decision about how and for what purpose the asset is used is predetermined, the Company \\nhas the right to direct the use of the asset if either:\\n   • The Company has the right to operate the asset; or\\n   • The Company designed the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purposes it will be used.\\n  As a practical expedient, Ind AS 116 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and instead account for \\nany lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. The Company has not used this practical \\nexpedient. At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the Company allocates the \\nconsideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices.\\n  The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use \\nasset is initially measured at cost, which comprises of the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease \\npayments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and estimated dilapidation \\ncosts, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently amortised using the straight-line \\nmethod over the shorter of the useful life of the leased asset or the period of lease. If ownership of the leased asset \\nis automatically transferred at the end of the lease term or the exercise of a purchase option is reflected in the lease \\npayments, the right-of-use asset is amortised on a straightline basis over the expected useful life of the leased asset.\\n  The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at commencement \\ndate, discounted using, the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company’s \\nincremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is \\nre measured when there is a change in future lease payments. The Company has elected not to recognise right-of-use \\nassets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low value \\nassets (lease of assets worth less than ₹ 0.03 crores) . The Company associates the lease payments associated with \\nthese leases as an expense on a straight line basis over the lease term.\\n  Lease payments include fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments, amounts expected to be payable \\nunder a residual value guarantee, the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to \\nexercise that option and payment of penalties for terminating the lease if the lease term considered reflects that \\nthe Company shall exercise termination option. The Company also recognises a right of use asset which comprises \\nof amount of initial measurement of the lease liability, any initial direct cost incurred by the Company and estimated \\ndilapidation costs.\\n293\\nSTANDALONE \\nFINANCIALS 383INTEGRATED  \\nREPORT 4 STATUTORY  \\nREPORTS 132 CONSOLIDATED \\nFINANCIALS\\n262'),\n",

Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially \\nall the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are \\nclassified as operating leases.\\n  Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recognised as receivables at the amount of the Company’s net \\ninvestment in the leases. Finance income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of \\nreturn on the Company’s net investment outstanding in respect of the leases.\\n  Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial \\ndirect costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased \\nasset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\\n (B) The Company leases a number of buildings, plant and equipment, IT hardware and software assets, certain of which \\nhave a renewal and/or purchase option in the normal course of the business. Extension and termination options \\nare included in a number of leases across the Company. The majority of extension and termination options held are \\nexercisable only by the Company and not by the respective lessor. The Company assesses at lease commencement \\nwhether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension or termination option. The Company re-assesses whether it \\nis reasonably certain to exercise options if there is a significant event or significant change in circumstances within its \\ncontrol.

It was further determined that this \\nincrease did not require the reversal of the previously recorded impairment loss as the underlying drivers for the increased \\nheadroom do not support a reversal, after considering the unwind of the discount rate and the impact of depreciation and \\namortisation of impaired assets.\\n JLR has considered it appropriate to undertake the impairment assessment with reference to the approved business plan \\nthat was in effect as at the assessment date. The business plan includes a five-year cash flow forecast and contains growth \\nrates that are primarily a function of the JLR’s Cycle Plan assumptions, historic performance and management’s expectation \\nof future market developments through to 2028/29.\\n In estimating the future cash flows management have given due consideration to the inherent uncertainty of forecast \\ninformation and have adjusted some of the assumptions in the business plan to take into account possible variations in \\nthe amount or timing of the cashflows. In doing so, management has incorporated execution risks associated with our \\n‘Reimagine’ strategy and the transition to electrified powertrain into the VIU, as well as other risks that may impact future \\ncash flows.\\n Climate risk \\n JLR recognises that the potential impact of climate risk to areas such as supply chain, operations, and material and compliance \\ncosts may result in variations to the timing and amounts of future cash flows. As such climate risk is incorporated into the \\ndevelopment of our forecast cash flows in the VIU by reference to our climate change risk assessment. These risks are \\nprincipally reflected by the risk adjustments related to the variable profit and volumes which would be most affected by \\nclimate change events, for example, scarcity of certain commodities driving up costs and therefore adversely impacting \\nvariable profit.\\n Key assumptions\\n The assessment of impairment is based on forecasts of future cashflows which are inherently uncertain and are developed \\nusing informed assumptions such as historical trends and market information. The key assumptions are:\\n i) the recoverable amount is most sensitive;\\n ii) involve a significant amount of judgement and estimation; and\\n iii) drive significant changes to the recoverable amount when flexed under reasonably possible outcomes.\\n Variable profit per unit and volumes – The approach to determining the forecast variable profit per unit and volumes \\nis based on consideration of historical performance, the order bank, profit optimisation efforts and Group Cycle Plan \\nassumptions, along with the impact of risks on future cashflows discussed above. A small change in either assumption may \\nhave a significant impact to future cashflows and for this reason, as well as the impact of risks associated with supply and \\ninflationary pressures on variable profit and volumes, the directors consider variable profit per unit and volumes to be \\nkey assumptions. Further, the variable profit per unit and volumes included in the business plan are largely driven by an \\nupdated portfolio, which includes estimates and judgements related to the transition to electrified powertrain, including \\nthe introduction of new Jaguar.\\n Terminal value capital expenditure – the five year cash flows timing and amount are based on the latest Cycle Plan. The \\nterminal value is based on the best estimate of a maintenance level of capital expenditure which has been derived from \\ndepreciation and amortisation expectations and funding requirements in responses to longer-term industry trends and \\nrisks informed by those listed above, which are anticipated in the VIU calculation. Due to the judgement and estimation \\ninvolved in the calculation of terminal value capital expenditure, as well as the sensitivity of the recoverable amount to any \\nchange in the value, JLR consider this to be a key assumption.\\n Discount rate – the approach to determining the discount rate is based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model and a market \\nparticipant after tax cost of debt. These inputs are based on a typical build up approach, calculated using country specific \\npremiums without size premium and with an unlevered equity Beta with reference to industry peers. The decrease in the \\nyear has mainly been driven by a decrease to the country risk premium. The discount rate is regarded as a key assumption \\nas it is the rate which drives the discounted cashflows used to determine the VIU of the CGU primarily due to the level of \\njudgement and estimation involved and the sensitivity of the recoverable amount to small changes in the percentage.\\n79th Integrated Annual Report\\n2023-24\\n300'),\n",

For example, the profit optimisation efforts discussed above will \\nlikely result in higher average variable profit per unit with lower volumes whereas a focus on volumes would likely see \\na reduction in the average variable profit per unit.

Income tax expense is recognised in the consolidated \\nstatement of profit and loss except when they relate to items that are recognised outside of profit or loss (whether in \\nother comprehensive income or directly in equity), in which case tax is also recognised outside profit or loss, or where \\nthey arise from the initial accounting for a business combination. In the case of a business combination the tax effect \\nis included in the accounting for the business combination. Current income taxes are determined based on respective \\ntaxable income of each taxable entity.\\n  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between \\nthe carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and unutilised business loss and depreciation \\ncarry-forwards and tax credits. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed separately for each taxable entity \\nand for each taxable jurisdiction. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that future taxable \\nincome will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses, depreciation carry \\nforwards and unused tax credits could be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each \\nreporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available \\nto allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\\n  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period \\nwhen the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or \\nsubstantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company recognised Deferred Tax Assets of ₹ 1,248.90 crores, \\nrespectively on previously unrecognized business losses based on the probability of sufficient taxable profit \\nin future periods against which such business losses will be set off. The Company utilised deferred tax asset \\npreviously created on the unabsorbed depreciation and capital loss during the year ended March 31, 2023 \\nagainst the profit on sale of investments in a subsidiary company and other income during the year ended March \\n31, 2024 amounting to ₹1,029.20 crores, respectively. \\n  2. During the previous year ended March 31, 2023, the Company recognised Deferred Tax Assets of ₹1,615.42 \\ncrores on previously unrecognised unused unabsorbed depreciation and long term capital losses based on the \\nprobability of sufficient taxable profit in future periods. \\n  3. During the year ended March 31, 2024, JLR has recognised deferred tax assets of ₹7,093.77 crores (£ 659 million) \\nin relation to unused tax losses on the basis that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against \\nwhich those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. The key assumptions to which the forecasts of \\nthe probable level of future taxable profits are most sensitive are wholesale volumes, variable profit per unit \\nand investment.\\n  4. In previous years, JLR reviewed tax assets and concluded that it was not probable that future taxable profits \\nwould be available against which the assets could be utilised, and accordingly had not recognised a net deferred \\ntax asset in respect of those assets. In making this assessment in previous periods it was considered that JLR \\nhad consistently generated taxable losses in recent years, was continuing to generate taxable losses in the then \\ncurrent period and was forecast to generate some taxable income in future periods that may not have been \\nsufficient to utilise the related tax assets. During the year ended March 31, 2024 there has been a significant \\nimprovement in performance. Sufficient taxable profits are forecast to be generated within the 5-year detailed \\nbusiness plan to utilise all of the net deferred tax asset prior to consideration of restrictions on the amount of \\nUK tax losses and UK tax depreciation that can be offset against UK taxable profits each year. As a result of these \\nUK tax rules the recoverability of all of the net UK deferred tax asset will continue beyond our 5-year detailed \\nbusiness plan. The forecasts are based on the Company’s impairment model. The sensitivity analysis applied \\nto the impairment model as described in does not impact the ability to recover the UK deferred tax asset in \\nfull. When the tax assets are utilised in future years it is expected that the impact will be recorded within the \\nunderlying tax charge for that year to match with the similar classification of the corresponding taxable profits \\nof that year.\\n   Significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the year ended March 31, 2024 are as follows:\\n(₹ in crores)\\nOpening balance \\n- restated**\\nRecognised in \\nstatement of \\nprofit and loss\\nRecognised in/reclassified from other \\ncomprehensive income\\nUtilization on \\nsale of stake \\nin a subsidiary \\ncompany\\nClosing balance\\nTranslation Other than \\ntranslation\\nDeferred tax assets:\\nUnabsorbed depreciation 2,850.21 (21.67) (0.03) -   (609.08) 2,219.43 \\nBusiness loss carry forwards 2,474.06 8,100.82 137.91 -   -   10,712.79 \\nOther tax losses -Long term capital \\nloss 150.48 (150.48) -   -   -   -   \\nExpenses deductible in future years:\\n- provisions, allowances for doubtful \\nreceivables 2,887.81 374.81 (39.01) -   -   3,223.61\\n- others - 114.87 1.93 - - 116.80\\nCompensated absences and \\nretirement benefits (1,339.74) (187.57) (84.57) 1,074.95 -   (536.93)\\nMinimum alternate tax carry-forward 114.51 (52.57) -   -   -   61.94 \\n-property, plant and equipment 7,716.32 520.11 768.39 -   -   9,004.82 \\nLease Liabilities 744.02 549.83 -   -   -   1,293.85 \\nDerivative financial instruments 575.55 157.77 21.43 (897.92) -   (143.17)\\nUnrealised profit on inventory 1,229.88 726.02 26.64 -   -   1,982.54 \\nOthers 2,315.69 434.84 42.88 4.10 -   2,797.51 \\nTotal deferred tax assets 19,718.79 10,566.78 875.57 181.13 (609.08) 30,733.19 \\n311\\nSTANDALONE \\nFINANCIALS 383INTEGRATED  \\nREPORT 4 STATUTORY  \\nREPORTS 132 CONSOLIDATED \\nFINANCIALS\\n262'),\n",

The \\nmeasurement of the provision considers the sales volume in that jurisdiction and the fee or cost per the applicable \\nlegislation.

Revenue from operations\\n (A) Accounting policy\\n  The Company generates revenue principally from –\\n  a) Sale of products – (i) commercial and passenger vehicles and vehicle parts and (ii) Sales of other products - \\ncertain software products and other automotive products.\\n   The Company recognises revenues from sale of products measured at the amount of transaction price (net of \\nvariable consideration), when it satisfies its performance obligation at a point in time which is when products \\nare delivered to dealers or when delivered to a carrier for export sales, which is when control including risks \\nand rewards and title of ownership pass to the customer, collectability of the resulting receivables is reasonably \\nassured and when there are no longer any unfulfilled obligation. The transaction price of goods sold is net of \\nvariable consideration on account of various discounts and schemes offered by the Company as part of the \\ncontract. The Company operates predominantly on cash and carry basis.\\n   The Company offers sales incentives in the form of variable marketing expense to customers, which vary \\ndepending on the timing and customer of any subsequent sale of the vehicle. This sales incentive is accounted for \\nas a revenue reduction and is constrained to a level that is highly probable not to reverse the amount of revenue \\nrecognised when any associated uncertainty is subsequently resolved. The Company estimates the expected \\nsales incentive by market and considers uncertainties including competitor pricing, ageing of retailer stock and \\nlocal market conditions.\\n   Revenue is recognised on a bill-and-hold basis where vehicles, for example, are sold to the customer but are \\nretained in the Company’s possession at a vehicle holding compound on behalf of the customer ahead of being \\nphysically transferred to them at a future time. In such arrangements it is ensured that the customer has obtained \\nthe ultimate control of the product.\\n   There are certain vehicles which are being given to the customers along with operations and maintenance of the \\nsame. These are considered as finance leases and accordingly, revenue is recognised at the lease commencement \\ndate at fair value of the leased asset. The cost of sales is reduced for the present value of unguaranteed residual \\nvalues. In addition, initial direct costs are recognised as cost of sales at the lease commencement date.\\n   The consideration received in respect of transport arrangements for delivering of vehicles to the customers are \\nrecognised net of their costs within revenues in the income statement.\\n   The Company applies the practical expedient in Ind AS 115 and does not disclose information about remaining \\nperformance obligations that have an original expected duration of one year or less. This is because revenue \\nresulting from those sales will be recognised in a short-term period. The services included with the vehicle \\nsale are to be recognised as revenues in subsequent years but represent an insignificant portion of expected \\nrevenues in comparison.\\n   Revenue from sale of vehicles to customers combined with repurchase obligation is recognised over the contract \\nperiod as if it were an operating lease contract. This is based on the fact that the customers had not obtained the \\ncontrol of the vehicle. The related inventory continues to be recognised in the Company’s consolidated balance \\nsheet. The consideration received from the customers is treated as liability.\\n  b) Sale of services - maintenance service, telematics features and extended warranties for commercial and \\npassenger vehicles, software support services and insurance broking services.\\n   Income from sale of maintenance services, telematics features and extended warranties, including software \\nservices are recognised as income over the relevant period of service or extended warranty.\\n327\\nSTANDALONE \\nFINANCIALS 383INTEGRATED  \\nREPORT 4 STATUTORY  \\nREPORTS 132 CONSOLIDATED \\nFINANCIALS\\n262'),\n",

In such cases, the transaction price allocated towards such maintenance \\nservice or extended period of warranty based on relative standalone selling price and is recognised as a contract \\nliability until the service obligation has been met. The price that is regularly charged for an item when sold \\nseparately is the best evidence of its standalone selling price. In the absence of such evidence, the primary \\nmethod used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin, under which the Company \\nestimates the cost of satisfying the performance obligation and then adds an appropriate margin based on \\nsimilar services.\\n   The Company operates certain customer loyalty programs under which customer is entitled to reward points \\non the spend towards Company’s products.

Financial instruments\\n (A) Accounting policy\\n  (i) Recognition\\n   A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or \\nequity instrument of another entity. Trade receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognised when \\nthey are originated. All other financial instruments are initially recognised when the Company becomes a party \\nto the contractual provisions of the instrument.\\n   Initial measurement\\n   Financial instruments are initially recognised at its fair value. Transaction costs directly attributable to the \\nacquisition or issue of financial instruments are recognised in determining the carrying amount, if it is not \\nclassified as at fair value through profit or loss. However, trade receivables that do not contain a significant \\nfinancing component are measured at transaction price. Transaction costs of financial instruments carried at fair \\nvalue through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss\\n   Subsequently, financial instruments are measured according to the category in which they are classified.\\n   Classification and measurement – financial assets\\n   Classification of financial assets is based on the business model in which the instruments are held as well as the \\ncharacteristics of their contractual cash flows. The business model is based on management’s intentions and \\npast pattern of transactions. Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when \\ndetermining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest. The Company reclassifies \\nfinancial assets when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.\\n   Financial assets are classified into three categories\\n   Financial assets at amortised cost: Financial assets having contractual terms that give rise on specified dates \\nto cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding and that are held \\nwithin a business model whose objective is to hold such assets in order to collect such contractual cash flows \\nare classified in this category. Subsequently, these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest \\nmethod less any impairment losses.\\n   Equity investments at fair value through other comprehensive income (Equity instruments): These include \\nfinancial assets that are equity instruments and are designated as such upon initial recognition irrevocably. \\nSubsequently, these are measured at fair value and changes therein are recognised directly in other comprehensive \\nincome, net of applicable income taxes.\\n   Dividends from these equity investments are recognised in the consolidated statement of Profit and Loss when \\nthe right to receive payment has been established.\\n   When the equity investment is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in equity is transferred to \\nretained earnings.\\n   Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (Debt instruments):  Financial assets having \\ncontractual terms that give rise on specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and \\ninterest on the principal outstanding and that are held within a business model whose objective is to hold such \\nassets in order to collect such contractual cash flows as well as to sell the financial asset, are classified in this \\ncategory. Subsequently, these are measured at fair value, with unrealised gains or losses being recognised in \\nother comprehensive income apart from any expected credit losses or foreign exchange gains or losses, which \\nare recognised in profit or loss.\\n   Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss:  Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit \\nand loss unless it is measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income on initial \\nrecognition. The transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair \\nvalue through profit and loss are immediately recognised in profit and loss.\\n79th Integrated Annual Report\\n2023-24\\n350'),\n",

A financial liability is classified as \\nat FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition. \\nFinancial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, \\nare recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the \\neffective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or \\nloss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss.\\n   Financial guarantee contracts:  These are initially measured at their fair values and, are subsequently measured \\nat the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined or the amount initially recognized less, the cumulative \\namount of income recognized.\\n   Other financial liabilities:  These are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\\n   Equity instruments:\\n   An equity instrument is any contract that evidences residual interests in the assets of the Company after \\ndeducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, \\nnet of direct issue costs.\\n  (ii)  Determination of fair value\\n   Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction \\nbetween market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or \\nestimated using another valuation technique.\\n   The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price (fair value of the \\nconsideration given or received).\\n   In estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, the Company takes into account the characteristics of the asset \\nor liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability \\nat the measurement date.\\n   Subsequent to initial recognition, the Company determines the fair value of financial instruments that are quoted \\nin active markets using the quoted bid prices (financial assets held) or quoted ask prices (financial liabilities \\nheld) and using valuation techniques for other instruments. Valuation techniques include discounted cash flow \\nmethod and other valuation methods\\n  (iii) Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities\\n   The Company derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset \\nexpires or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to \\nanother entity. If the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership \\nand continues to control the transferred asset, the Company recognises its retained interest in the asset and an \\nassociated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards \\nof ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Company continues to recognise the financial asset and also \\nrecognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is \\nrecognised in profit or loss. When a financial instrument is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in equity \\nis transferred to the statement of profit and loss unless it was an equity instrument electively held at fair value \\nthrough other comprehensive income. In this case, any cumulative gain or loss in equity is transferred to retained \\nearnings. Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The Company \\nreviews the facts and circumstances around each asset before making a determination. Financial assets that are \\nwritten off could still be subject to enforcement activities.\\n   Financial liabilities are decrecognised when these are extinguished, that is when the obligation is discharged, \\ncancelled or has expired.\\n351\\nSTANDALONE \\nFINANCIALS 383INTEGRATED  \\nREPORT 4 STATUTORY  \\nREPORTS 132 CONSOLIDATED \\nFINANCIALS\\n262'),\n",

Expected credit losses are forward looking and are \\nmeasured in a way that is unbiased and represents a probability-weighted amount, takes into account the time \\nvalue of money (values are discounted using the applicable effective interest rate) and uses reasonable and \\nsupportable information.\\n  (v) Hedge accounting\\n   The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency \\nfluctuations relating to highly probable forecast transactions. The Company designates these forward contracts \\nin a cash flow hedging relationship by applying the hedge accounting principles. The Company also uses interest \\nrate swaps to hedge its variability in cash flows from interest payments arising from floating rate liabilities i.e. \\nwhen interests are paid according to benchmark market interest rates.\\n   Derivatives are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair \\nvalue, and changes therein are generally recognised in profit or loss.\\n   At inception of the hedge relationship, the Company documents the economic relationship between the hedging \\ninstrument and the hedged item, including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging instrument are \\nexpected to offset changes in the cash flows of the hedged item. The Company documents its risk management \\nobjective and strategy for undertaking its hedging transactions. The Company designates only the intrinsic value \\nof foreign exchange options in the hedging relationship. The Company designates amounts excluding foreign \\ncurrency basis spread in the hedging relationship for both foreign exchange forward contracts and cross- currency \\ninterest rate swaps. Changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts that are designated and effective as \\nhedges of future cash flows are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within other comprehensive income \\n(net of tax), and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.\\n   Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the consolidated statement of Profit and Loss or Balance \\nSheet in the periods in which the forecasted transactions occurs.\\n   For forwards and options, forward premium and the time value are not considered part of the hedge. These are \\ntreated as cost of hedge and the changes in fair value attributable to forward premium is recognised in the other \\ncomprehensive income along with the changes in fair value determined to be effective portion of the hedge.\\n   Effective portion of fair value changes of interest rate swaps that are designated as hedges against interest rate \\nrisk arising from floating rate debt are recognised in other comprehensive income.\\n   Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or \\nno longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the consolidated \\nstatement of profit and loss in the periods in which the forecast transactions affect profit or loss or as an \\nadjustment to a non-financial item (e.g. inventory) when that item is recognised on the balance sheet. These \\ndeferred amounts are ultimately recognised in profit or loss as the hedged item affects profit or loss (for example \\nthrough cost of goods sold). For forecast transactions, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument \\nrecognised in equity is retained there until the forecast transaction occurs.\\n   If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is \\nimmediately transferred to the consolidated statement of Profit and Loss for the year.\\n  (B) Disclosure on financial instruments\\n  This section gives an overview of the significance of financial instruments for the Company and provides additional \\ninformation on balance sheet items that contain financial instruments.\\n  The details of significant accounting policies, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the \\nbasis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and \\nequity instrument are disclosed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.\\n79th Integrated Annual Report\\n2023-24\\n352'),\n",

Upon the application of Ind AS 109, \\nthe Company has chosen to designate these investments in equity instruments as at FVTOCI as the management \\nbelieve that this provides a more meaningful presentation for medium or long-term strategic investments, than \\nreflecting changes in fair value in profit or loss.\\n   For the year ended March 31, 2024 valuation of Compulsorily Convertible Preference Share (CCPS) financial \\nliability is carried out by the management using combination of Monte Carlo simulation approach which is a \\nstatistical technique that is used to simulate equity value of the Company and projected Cashflow discounted \\nusing risk free interest rate prevailing on the date of valuation. Since significant unobservable inputs are applied \\nin measuring the fair value, financial liability is classified in Level 3.\\n   Fair values of forward derivatives and commodity swap contracts are estimated by discounting expected future \\ncontractual cash flows using prevailing market interest rate curves. Option contracts are fair valued using \\nstandard options pricing methodology, based on prevailing market interest rates and volatility.\\n355\\nSTANDALONE \\nFINANCIALS 383INTEGRATED  \\nREPORT 4 STATUTORY  \\nREPORTS 132 CONSOLIDATED \\nFINANCIALS\\n262'),\n",

The \\nCompany’s interest rate exposure is mainly related to debt obligations. The Company also uses a mix \\nof interest rate sensitive financial instruments to manage the liquidity and fund requirements for its \\nday to day operations like short term non-convertible bonds and short term loans.\\n     In its financing business, the Company enters into transactions with customers which primarily result \\nin receivables at fixed rates. In order to manage this risk, the Company has a policy to match funding \\nin terms of maturities and interest rates and also for certain part of the portfolio, the Company does \\nnot match funding with maturities, in order to take advantage of market opportunities.\\n     The Company also enters into arrangements of securitization of receivables in order to reduce the \\nimpact of interest rate movements. Further, Company also enters into interest rate swap contracts \\nwith banks to manage its interest rate risk.\\n     As at March 31, 2024 and 2023 financial liabilities of ₹ 42,719.24 crores  and ₹48,076.94 crores \\nrespectively, were subject to variable interest rates. Increase/decrease of 100 basis points in interest \\nrates at the balance sheet date would result in an impact (decrease/increase of profit before tax) of \\n₹427.19  crores and ₹4 8 0.7 7  crores on income for the year ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, resp ec ti vely.\\n     The model assumes that interest rate changes are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve. \\nAlthough some assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to re-pricing, these may \\nnot react correspondingly to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on some types of \\nassets and liabilities may fluctuate with changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other \\ntypes of assets may change with a lag.\\n     The risk estimates provided assume a parallel shift of 100 basis points interest rate across all yield \\ncurves. This calculation also assumes that the change occurs at the balance sheet date and has been \\ncalculated based on risk exposures outstanding as at that date. The period end balances are not \\nnecessarily representative of the average debt outstanding during the period.\\n     This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.\\n     The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge some of its exposure to interest rate \\narising from variable rate foreign currency denominated debt. The Company also uses cross currency \\ninterest rate swaps to convert some of its foreign currency denominated fixed rate debt to floating \\nrate debt.\\n79th Integrated Annual Report\\n2023-24\\n362'),\n",

Material accounting policies\\n (a)  Statement of compliance\\n  These financial statements have been prepared \\nin accordance with Indian Accounting Standards \\n(“Ind AS”) as notified under the Companies (Indian \\nAccounting Standards) Rules, 2015 read with \\nSection 133 of the Companies Act, 2013  (the “Act”) \\nas amended from time to time. \\n (b)  Basis of preparation\\n  These financial statements have been prepared \\non historical cost basis except for certain financial \\ninstruments which are measured at fair value at \\nthe end of each reporting period as explained \\nin the accounting policies below. All amounts \\nhave been rounded to the nearest crores, unless \\notherwise indicated.\\n  Joint operations :\\n  Certain of the Company’s activities, are conducted \\nthrough a joint operation, which is a joint \\narrangement whereby the parties that have joint \\ncontrol of the arrangement have rights to the \\nassets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating \\nto the arrangement. As per Ind AS 111 - Joint \\narrangements, in its separate financial statements, \\nthe Company being a joint operator has recognised \\nits share of the assets, liabilities, income and \\nexpenses of these joint operations incurred jointly \\nwith the other partners, along with its share of \\nincome from the sale of the output and any assets, \\nliabilities and expenses that it has incurred in \\nrelation to the joint operation.\\n  Although not required by Ind AS, the Company has \\nprovided in note 46 additional information of Tata \\nMotors Limited on a standalone basis excluding its \\ninterest in its Joint Operation viz. Tata Cummins \\nPrivate Limited (including its subsidiary company).\\n (c) Use of estimates and judgements\\n  The preparation of financial statements in \\nconformity with Ind AS requires management \\nto make judgments, estimates and assumptions, \\nthat affect the application of accounting policies \\nand the reported amounts of assets, liabilities \\nand disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities \\nat the date of these financial statements and the \\nreported amounts of revenues and expenses for \\nthe years presented. Actual results may differ from \\nthese estimates and judgements. \\n  Estimates\\n  Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed \\nat each balance sheet date. Revisions to accounting \\nestimates are recognised in the period in which the \\nestimate is revised and in future periods affected.\\n  In particular, information about significant areas \\nof estimation uncertainty and critical judgments \\nin applying accounting policies that have the \\nmost significant effect on the amounts recognised \\nin the financial statements are included in the \\nfollowing notes:\\n  i) Note 3 and Note 5 - Property, plant and \\nequipment and Intangible assets- useful life \\nand impairment\\n  ii) Note 28 - Recoverability/recognition of \\ndeferred tax assets\\n  iii) Note 27 - Provision for product warranty\\n  iv) Note 33(B) - Assets and obligations relating to \\nemployee benefits\\n  Judgements\\n  i) Revenue recognition: The Company uses \\njudgement to determine when control of its \\ngoods, primarily vehicles and parts, pass to \\nthe customer.

The Company has opted for an exemption \\nas per para 4 of Ind AS 108. Segment information is \\nthus given in the consolidated financial statements \\nof the Company.\\n (g) Going concern\\n  The Company’s financial statements have been \\nprepared on a going concern basis.\\n  The Company has performed an assessment of \\nits financial position as at March 31, 2024 and \\nforecasts of the Company for a period of eighteen \\nmonths from the date of these financial statements \\n(the ‘Going Concern Assessment Period’ and the \\n‘Foreseeable Future’).\\n  In developing these forecasts, the Company has \\nmodelled a base case, which has been further \\nsensitised using severe but plausible downside \\nscenarios. It also accounts for other end-market \\nand operational factors throughout the Going \\nConcern Assessment Period. This has been further \\nsensitized using more severe but plausible scenarios \\nconsidering external market commentaries and \\nother factors impacting the global economy and \\nautomotive industry. Management do not consider \\nmore extreme scenarios than the ones assessed to \\nbe plausible.\\n  In evaluating the forecasts, the Company has \\ntaken into consideration both the sufficiency of \\nliquidity to meet obligations as they fall due as well \\nas potential impact on compliance with financial \\ncovenants during the forecast period. These \\nforecasts indicate that, based on cash generated \\nfrom operations, the existing funding facilities and \\ninter corporate deposits from subsidiaries, the \\nCompany will have sufficient liquidity to operate \\nand discharge its liabilities as they become due, \\nwithout breaching any relevant covenants and the \\nneed for any mitigating actions.\\n  Based on the evaluation described above, \\nmanagement believes that the Company has \\nsufficient financial resources available to it at the \\ndate of approval of these financial statements and \\nthat it will be able to continue as a ‘going concern’ \\nin the foreseeable future and for a period up to \\nSeptember 30, 2025.\\n (h) Impairment\\n  At each balance sheet date, the Company assesses \\nwhether there is any indication that any property, \\nplant and equipment and intangible assets with \\nfinite lives may be impaired. If any such impairment \\nexists, the recoverable amount of an asset is \\nestimated to determine the extent of impairment, \\nif any. Where it is not possible to estimate the \\nrecoverable amount of an individual asset, the \\nCompany estimates the recoverable amount of the \\ncash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.\\n  Intangible assets not yet available for use, are \\ntested for impairment annually at each balance \\nsheet date, or earlier, if there is an indication that \\nthe asset may be impaired.  \\n  Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less \\ncosts to sell and value in use. In assessing value in \\nuse, the estimated future cash flows are discounted \\nto their present value using a pre-tax discount rate \\nthat reflects current market assessments of the \\ntime value of money and the risks specific to the \\nasset for which the estimates of future cash flows \\nhave not been adjusted.\\n  If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-\\ngenerating unit) is estimated to be less than its \\ncarrying amount, the carrying amount of the \\n403\\nSTANDALONE \\nFINANCIALS 383INTEGRATED  \\nREPORT 4 STATUTORY  \\nREPORTS 132 CONSOLIDATED \\nFINANCIALS\\n262'),\n",

Property, plant and equipment\\n (a) Accounting policy\\n  Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost \\nof acquisition or construction less accumulated \\ndepreciation and impairment, if any. \\n  Freehold land is measured at cost and is \\nnot depreciated. \\n  Cost includes purchase price, non-recoverable \\ntaxes and duties, labour cost and direct overheads \\nfor self-constructed assets and other direct costs \\nincurred up to the date the asset is ready for its \\nintended use.\\n  Subsequent expenditure relating to property, \\nplant and equipment is capitalised only when it is \\nprobable that future economic benefits associated \\nwith these will flow to the Company and the cost \\nof the item can be measured reliably. Repairs and \\nmaintenance costs are recognized in the statement \\nof profit and loss when incurred.\\n  Interest cost incurred is capitalised up to the date \\nthe asset is ready for its intended use for qualifying \\nassets, based on borrowings incurred specifically \\nfor financing the asset or the weighted average rate \\nof all other borrowings, if no specific borrowings \\nhave been incurred for the asset. \\n  Depreciation is provided on the Straight Line \\nMethod (SLM) over the estimated useful lives of \\nthe assets considering the nature, estimated usage, \\noperating conditions, past history of replacement, \\nanticipated technological changes, manufacturers’ \\nwarranties and maintenance support.

Leases\\n (a)  Accounting policy\\n  Lessee:\\n  At inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether a contract is, or contain a lease. A contract is, or contains, \\na lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for \\nconsideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company \\nassesses whether:\\n  • The contract involves the use of an identified asset –this may be specified explicitly or implicitly, and should be \\nphysically distinct or represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically distinct asset. If the supplier has a \\nsubstantive substation right, then the asset is not identified;\\n  • The Company has the right to substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the \\nperiod of use; and\\n  • The Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. The Company has this right when it has the decision \\nmaking rights that are most relevant to changing how and for what purposes the asset is used. In rare cases \\nwhere the decision about how and for what purpose the asset is used is predetermined, the Company has the \\nright to direct the use of the asset if either:\\n   • The Company has the right to operate the asset; or\\n   • The Company designed the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purposes it will be used.\\n  As a practical expedient, Ind AS 116 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and instead account for \\nany lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. The Company has not used this practical \\nexpedient. At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the Company allocates the \\nconsideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices.\\n  The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use \\nasset is initially measured at cost, which comprises of the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease \\npayments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and estimated dilapidation \\ncosts, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently amortised using the straight-line \\nmethod over the shorter of the useful life of the leased asset or the period of lease. If ownership of the leased asset \\nis automatically transferred at the end of the lease term or the exercise of a purchase option is reflected in the lease \\npayments, the right-of-use asset is amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the leased asset.\\n  The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at commencement \\ndate, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company’s \\nincremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is \\nre-measured when there is a change in future lease payments.\\n  Lease payments include fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments, amounts expected to be payable \\nunder a residual value guarantee, the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to \\nexercise that option and payment of penalties for terminating the lease if the lease term considered reflects that \\nthe Company shall exercise termination option. The Company also recognises a right-of-use asset which comprises \\nof amount of initial measurement of the lease liability, any initial direct cost incurred by the Company and estimated \\ndilapidation costs.\\n  Payment made towards short term leases (leases for which non-cancellable term is 12 months or lesser) and low \\nvalue assets (lease of assets worth less than ₹0.03 crores) are recognised in the statement of Profit and Loss as rental \\nexpenses over the tenor of such leases.\\n  Lessor:\\n  At the inception of a lease, the lease arrangement is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease, based \\non contractual terms and substance of the lease arrangement. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially \\nall the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are \\nclassified as operating leases.\\n407\\nSTANDALONE \\nFINANCIALS 383INTEGRATED  \\nREPORT 4 STATUTORY  \\nREPORTS 132 CONSOLIDATED \\nFINANCIALS\\n262'),\n",

Provisions\\n (a)  Accounting policy\\n  A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation \\nthat can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the \\nobligation. When the effect of the time value of money ismaterial, provisions are determined by discounting the \\nexpected future cash flows using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money \\nand the risks specific to the liability.\\n  Product warranty expenses\\n  The estimated liability for product warranties is recognised when products are sold or when new warranty programmes \\nare initiated. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost \\nof warranty claims and management estimates regarding possible future warranty claims, customer goodwill and \\nrecall complaints. The timing of outflows will vary depending on when warranty claim will arise, being typically up to \\nsix years. The Company also has back-to-back contractual arrangement with its suppliers in the event that a vehicle \\nfault is proven to be a supplier’s fault.\\n  Estimates are made of the expected reimbursement claim based upon historical levels of recoveries from supplier, \\nadjusted for inflation and applied to the population of vehicles under warranty as on Balance Sheet date.

Income taxes\\n (a)  Accounting policy\\n  Income tax expense comprises current tax and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the statement of \\nProfit and Loss except when they relate to items that are recognised outside of profit and loss (whether in other \\ncomprehensive income or directly in equity), in which case tax is also recognised outside profit and loss. Current \\nincome taxes are determined based on respective taxable income of each taxable entity.\\n  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between \\nthe carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and unutilised business loss and depreciation \\ncarry-forwards and tax credits. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed separately for each taxable \\nentity. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that future taxable income will be available \\nagainst which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses, depreciation carry-forwards and unused tax \\ncredits could be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced \\nto the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset \\nto be recovered.\\n  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period \\nwhen the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or \\nsubstantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there \\nis a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income \\ntaxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on \\na net basis. The extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognised is based on an assessment of the probability \\nthat future taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax loss carry-\\nforwards can be utilised.\\n  Deferred tax liabilities on taxable temporary differences arising from interests in joint arrangements are not recognised \\nif the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal and it is probable that the temporary difference will not \\nreverse in the foreseeable future.\\n  Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”), under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023, \\nissued an amendment to Ind AS 12 Income Taxes related Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction such \\nas leases and decommissioning obligations. This amendment is effective from the beginning of comparative period \\npresented i.e. April1, 2022. There is a change in Deferred tax component disclosure from net to gross for right to use \\nassets and lease liabilities for the Company.

Revenue recognition\\n (a) Accounting policy\\n  The Company generates revenue principally from-\\n  i)  Sale of products - commercial vehicles and vehicle parts .\\n   The Company recognises revenues from sale of products measured at the amount of transaction price (net of \\nvariable consideration), when it satisfies its performance obligation at a point in time which is when products \\nare delivered to dealers or when delivered to a carrier for export sales, which is when control including risks \\nand rewards and title of ownership pass to the customer, collectability of the resulting receivables is reasonably \\nassured and when there are no longer any unfulfilled obligation. The transaction price of goods sold is net of \\nvariable consideration on account of various discounts and schemes offered by the Company as part of the \\ncontract. The Company operates predominantly on cash and carry basis.\\n   The Company offers sales incentives in the form of variable marketing expense to customers, which vary \\ndepending on the timing and customer of any subsequent sale of the vehicle. This sales incentive is accounted for \\nas a revenue reduction and is constrained to a level that is highly probable not to reverse the amount of revenue \\nrecognised when any associated uncertainty is subsequently resolved. The Company estimates the expected \\nsales incentive by market and considers uncertainties including competitor pricing, ageing of retailer stock and \\nlocal market conditions.\\n   The consideration received in respect of transport arrangements for delivering of vehicles to the customers are \\nrecognised net of their costs within revenues in the income statement.\\n  ii) Sale of services - maintenance service and extended warranties for commercial vehicles.\\n   Income from sale of maintenance services and extended warranties are recognised as income over the relevant \\nperiod of service or extended warranty.\\n   When the Company sells products that are bundled with maintenance service or extended period of warranty, \\nsuch services are treated as a separate performance obligation only if the service or warranty is in excess of the \\nstandard offerings to the customer. In such cases, the transaction price allocated towards such maintenance \\nservice or extended period of warranty based on relative standalone selling price and is recognised as a contract \\nliability until the service obligation has been met. The price that is regularly charged for an item when sold \\nseparately is the best evidence of its standalone selling price. In the absence of such evidence, the primary \\nmethod used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin, under which the Company \\nestimates the cost of satisfying the performance obligation and then adds an appropriate margin based on \\nsimilar services.\\n   The Company operates certain customer loyalty programs under which customer is entitled to reward points \\non the spend towards Company’s products. The reward points earned by customers can be redeemed to claim \\ndiscounts on future purchase of certain products or services. Transaction price allocated towards reward points \\ngranted to customers is recognised as a deferred income liability and transferred to income when customers \\nredeem their reward points.\\n   Sales of services include certain performance obligations that are satisfied over a period of time. Any amount \\nreceived in advance in respect of such performance obligations that are satisfied  over a period of time is \\nrecorded as a contract liability and recorded as revenue when service is rendered to customers.\\n   Refund liabilities comprise of obligation towards customers to pay for discounts and sales incentives.\\n79th Integrated Annual Report\\n2023-24\\n432'),\n",

The plan provides for a lump-sum payment to vested employees at \\nretirement, death while in employment or on termination of employment of an amount equivalent to 15 to \\n30 days salary payable for each completed year of service. Vesting occurs upon completion of five years of \\nservice. Tata Motors Limited makes annual contributions to gratuity funds established as trusts. Tata Motors \\nLimited account for the liability for gratuity benefits payable in the future based on an actuarial valuation.\\n   (ii) Superannuation\\n    Tata Motors Limited have two superannuation plans, a defined benefit plan and a defined contribution \\nplan. An eligible employee on April 1, 1996 could elect to be a member of either plan.\\n    Employees who are members of the defined benefit superannuation plan are entitled to benefits depending \\non the years of service and salary drawn. The monthly pension benefits after retirement range from 0.75% \\nto 2% of the annual basic salary for each year of service. Tata Motors Limited account for superannuation \\nbenefits payable in future under the plan based on an actuarial valuation.\\n    With effect from April 1, 2003, this plan was amended and benefits earned by covered employees have \\nbeen protected as at March 31, 2003. Employees covered by this plan are prospectively entitled to benefits \\ncomputed on a basis that ensures that the annual cost of providing the pension benefits would not exceed \\n15% of salary.\\n    During the year ended March 31, 2015, the employees covered by this plan were given a one-time option \\nto exit from the plan prospectively. Furthermore, the employees who opted for exit were given one- time \\noption to withdraw accumulated balances from the superannuation plan.\\n    The Company maintains a separate irrevocable trust for employees covered and entitled to benefits. The \\nCompany contributes up to 15% or ₹1,50,000 whichever is lower of the eligible employee’s salary to the \\ntrust every year. The Company recognises such contribution as an expense when incurred and has no \\nfurther obligation beyond this contribution.\\n   (iii)  Bhavishya kalyan yojana (BKY)\\n    Bhavishya Kalyan Yojana is an unfunded defined benefit plan for employees of Tata Motors Limited. The \\nbenefits of the plan include pension in certain cases, payable up to the date of normal superannuation had \\nthe employee been in service, to an eligible employee at the time of death or permanent disablement, while \\nin service, either as a result of an injury or as certified by the appropriate authority. The monthly payment \\nto dependents of the deceased/disabled employee under the plan equals 50% of the salary drawn at the \\ntime of death or accident or a specified amount, whichever is greater. Tata Motors Limited account for the \\nliability for BKY benefits payable in the future based on an actuarial valuation.\\n   (iv)  Provident fund and family pension\\n    In accordance with Indian law, eligible employees of Tata Motors Limited and joint operations are entitled to \\nreceive benefits in respect of provident fund, a defined contribution plan, in which both employees and the \\nCompany make monthly contributions at a specified percentage of the covered employees’ salary (currently \\n12% of employees’ salary). The contributions, as specified under the law, were made to the provident fund \\nand pension fund set up as an irrevocable trust or to respective Regional Provident Fund Commissioner and \\nthe Central Provident Fund under the State Pension scheme. The interest rate, payable to the members of \\nthe trust, was not to be lower than the statutory rate of interest declared by the Central Government under \\nthe Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and shortfall, if any, was made good \\nby the Company. The embedded interest rate guarantee is considered to be defined benefit.\\n    The provident fund trust and pension trust set up by Tata Motors Limited (the “Company”) have lost its \\nexempt status w.e.f. April 1, 2022, due to incurrence of losses for three consecutive years by the Company, \\nas per its standalone financial statements prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards. \\nAccordingly, the Company has surrendered the provident fund exemption and transferred the assets \\n79th Integrated Annual Report\\n2023-24\\n436'),\n",

Financial instruments\\n (a)  Accounting policy\\n  i)  Recognition:\\n   A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or \\nequity instrument of another entity.\\n   Trade receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognised when they are originated. All other financial \\ninstruments are initially recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of \\nthe instrument.\\n   Initial measurement\\n   Financial instruments are initially recognised at its fair value. Transaction costs directly attributable to the \\nacquisition or issue of financial instruments are recognised in determining the carrying amount, if it is not \\nclassified as at fair value through profit or loss. However, trade receivables that do not contain a significant \\nfinancing component are measured at transaction price. Transaction costs of financial instruments carried at fair \\nvalue through profit or loss are expensed in the statement of profit and loss.\\n   Subsequently, financial instruments are measured according to the category in which they are classified.\\n   Classification and measurement – financial assets\\n   Classification of financial assets is based on the business model in which the instruments are held as well as the \\ncharacteristics of their contractual cash flows. The business model is based on management’s intentions and \\npast pattern of transactions. Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when \\ndetermining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest. The Company reclassifies \\nfinancial assets when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.\\n   Financial assets are classified into three categories\\n   Financial assets at amortised cost: Financial assets having contractual terms that give rise on specified dates \\nto cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding and that are held \\nwithin a business model whose objective is to hold such assets in order to collect such contractual cash flows \\nare classified in this category.

A financial liability is classified as \\nat FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition. \\nFinancial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, \\nare recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the \\neffective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or \\nloss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss.\\n   Financial guarantee contracts: These are initially measured at their fair values and, are subsequently measured \\nat the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined or the amount initially recognised less, the cumulative \\namount of income recognised.\\n   Other financial liabilities: These are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\\n   Equity instruments:\\n   An equity instrument is any contract that evidences residual interests in the assets of the Company after \\ndeducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, \\nnet of direct issue costs.\\n  ii) Determination of fair value:\\n   Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction \\nbetween market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or \\nestimated using another valuation technique.\\n   The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price (fair value of the \\nconsideration given or received).\\n   In estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, the Company takes into account the characteristics of the asset \\nor liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability \\nat the measurement date.\\n   Subsequent to initial recognition, the Company determines the fair value of financial instruments that are quoted \\nin active markets using the quoted bid prices (financial assets held) or quoted ask prices (financial liabilities \\nheld) and using valuation techniques for other instruments. Valuation techniques include discounted cash flow \\nmethod and other valuation methods.\\n  iii) Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities:\\n   The Company derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset \\nexpires or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to \\nanother entity. If the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership \\nand continues to control the transferred asset, the Company recognises its retained interest in the asset and an \\nassociated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards \\nof ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Company continues to recognise the financial asset and also \\nrecognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is \\nrecognised in profit or loss. When a financial instrument is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in equity \\nis transferred to the statement of profit and loss unless it was an equity instrument electively held at fair value \\nthrough other comprehensive income. In this case, any cumulative gain or loss in equity is transferred to retained \\nearnings. Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The Company \\nreviews the facts and circumstances around each asset before making a determination. Financial assets that are \\nwritten off could still be subject to enforcement activities.\\n   Financial liabilities are decrecognised when these are extinguished, that is when the obligation is discharged, \\ncancelled or has expired.\\n449\\nSTANDALONE \\nFINANCIALS 383INTEGRATED  \\nREPORT 4 STATUTORY  \\nREPORTS 132 CONSOLIDATED \\nFINANCIALS\\n262'),\n",

Expected credit losses are forward looking and are \\nmeasured in a way that is unbiased and represents a probability-weighted amount, takes into account the time \\nvalue of money (values are discounted using the applicable effective interest rate) and uses reasonable and \\nsupportable information.\\n  v)  Hedge accounting:\\n   The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency \\nfluctuations relating to highly probable forecast transactions. The Company designates these forward contracts \\nin a cash flow hedging relationship by applying the hedge accounting principles. The Company also uses interest \\nrate swaps to hedge its variability in cash flows from interest payments arising from floating rate liabilities i.e. \\nwhen interests are paid according to benchmark market interest rates.\\n   Derivatives are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair \\nvalue, and changes therein are generally recognised in profit or loss.\\n   At inception of the hedge relationship, the Company documents the economic relationship between the hedging \\ninstrument and the hedged item, including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging instrument are \\nexpected to offset changes in the cash flows of the hedged item. The Company documents its risk management \\nobjective and strategy for undertaking its hedging transactions. The Company designates only the intrinsic value \\nof foreign exchange options in the hedging relationship. The Company designates amounts excluding foreign \\ncurrency basis spread in the hedging relationship for both foreign exchange forward contracts and cross- currency \\ninterest rate swaps. Changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts that are designated and effective as \\nhedges of future cash flows are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within other comprehensive income \\n(net of tax), and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss.\\n   Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the statement of Profit and Loss or Balance Sheet in the \\nperiods in which the forecasted transactions occurs.\\n   For forwards and options, forward premium and the time value are not considered part of the hedge. These are \\ntreated as cost of hedge and the changes in fair value attributable to forward premium is recognised in the other \\ncomprehensive income along with the changes in fair value determined to be effective portion of the hedge.\\n   Effective portion of fair value changes of interest rate swaps that are designated as hedges against interest rate \\nrisk arising from floating rate debt are recognised in other comprehensive income.\\n   Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or \\nno longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the statement of \\nprofit and loss in the periods in which the forecast transactions affect profit or loss or as an adjustment to a non-\\nfinancial item (e.g. inventory) when that item is recognised on the balance sheet. These deferred amounts are \\nultimately recognised in profit or loss as the hedged item affects profit or loss (for example through cost of goods \\nsold). For forecast transactions, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is \\nretained there until the forecast transaction occurs.\\n   If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is \\nimmediately transferred to the statement of Profit and Loss for the year.\\n79th Integrated Annual Report\\n2023-24\\n450'),\n",

Future specific market movements cannot be normally predicted with \\nreasonable accuracy.\\n    (a)  Foreign currency exchange rate risk:\\n      The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the income statement, \\nstatement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, statement of changes in equity and statement of \\ncash flows where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets/liabilities are \\ndenominated in a currency other than the functional currency.\\n      Considering the countries and economic environment in which the Company operates, its operations \\nare subject to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates in those countries. The risks primarily \\nrelate to fluctuations in U.S. dollar, Euro and GBP against the respective functional currencies of \\nthe Company.\\n      The Company, as per its risk management policy, uses foreign exchange and other derivative instruments \\nprimarily to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate exposure. Any weakening of the functional \\ncurrency may impact the Company’s cost of exports and cost of borrowings and consequently may \\nincrease the cost of financing the Company’s capital expenditures.\\n    The Company evaluates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by assessing its exposure to \\nexchange rate risks. It hedges a part of these risks by using derivative financial instruments in accordance \\nwith its risk management policies.\\n    The foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated for each currency by aggregation of the net foreign \\nexchange rate exposure of each currency and a simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift in the \\nforeign exchange rates of each currency by 10% while keeping the other variables as constant.\\n    The exposure as indicated below is mitigated by some of the derivative contracts entered into by the \\nCompany as disclosed in clause  (iv) derivative financial instruments and risk management below.\\n    The following table sets forth information relating to foreign currency exposure (other than risk arising from \\nderivatives disclosed at clause (iv) below) as of March 31, 2024:\\n(₹ in crores)\\nU.S. Dollar GBP Others 1 Total\\nFinancial assets 319.22 63.69 60.99 443.90\\nFinancial liabilities 3,861.41 2.24 52.97 3,916.62\\n    1Others mainly include currencies such as the Euro, Chinese Yuan, South African Rand, Singapore Dollar, \\nThai Bahts and Bangladesh Taka.\\n     10% appreciation/depreciation of the respective foreign currencies with respect to functional currency of \\nthe Company would result in decrease/increase in the Company’s net profit/(loss) and equity before tax by \\napproximately ₹44.39 crores and ₹391.66 crores for financial assets and financial liabilities respectively for \\nthe year ended March 31, 2024.\\n     The following table sets forth information relating to foreign currency exposure (other than risk arising from \\nderivatives disclosed at clause (iv) below) as of March 31, 2023:\\n(₹ in crores)\\nU.S. Dollar GBP Others 2 Total\\nFinancial assets 276.14 80.38 42.28 398.80\\nFinancial liabilities 6,735.99 7.89 73.70 6,817.58\\n    2Others mainly include currencies such as the Euro, Chinese Yuan, South African Rand, Singapore Dollar, \\nThai Bahts and Bangladesh Taka.\\n    10% appreciation/depreciation of the respective foreign currencies with respect to functional currency of \\nthe Company would result in decrease/increase in the Company’s net profit/(loss) and equity before tax by \\napproximately ₹39.88 crores and ₹681.76 crores for financial assets and financial liabilities respectively for \\nthe year ended March 31, 2023.\\n    (Note: The impact is indicated on the profit before tax.)\\n455\\nSTANDALONE \\nFINANCIALS 383INTEGRATED  \\nREPORT 4 STATUTORY  \\nREPORTS 132 CONSOLIDATED \\nFINANCIALS\\n262'),\n",

The Company’s \\ninterest rate exposure is mainly related to debt obligations. The Company also uses a mix of interest rate \\nsensitive financial instruments to manage the liquidity and fund requirements for its day to day operations like \\nshort term loans.\\n   As at March 31, 2024 and 2023, financial liabilities of ₹3,783.43 crores and ₹4,493.80 crores, respectively, were \\nsubject to variable interest rates. Increase/decrease of 100 basis points in interest rates at the balance sheet \\ndate would result in decrease/increase in profit before tax of ₹37.83 crores and ₹44.94 crores for the year ended \\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\\n   The model assumes that interest rate changes are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve. Although some \\nassets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to re-pricing, these may not react correspondingly \\nto changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on some types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate \\nwith changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types of assets may change with a lag.\\n   The risk estimates provided assume a parallel shift of 100 basis points interest rate across all yield curves. This \\ncalculation also assumes that the change occurs at the balance sheet date and has been calculated based on risk \\nexposures outstanding as at that date. The period end balances are not necessarily representative of the average \\ndebt outstanding during the period.\\n   This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.\\n   (Note: The impact is indicated on the profit before tax.)\\n  (c) Equity Price risk\\n   Equity Price Risk is related to the change in market reference price of the investments in equity securities.\\n   The fair value of some of the Company’s investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive \\nincome exposes the Company to equity price risks. These investments are subject to changes in the market price \\nof securities. The fair value of Company’s investment in quoted equity securities as of March 31, 2024 and 2023 \\nwas ₹856.59 crores and ₹574.37 crores, respectively. A 10% change in equity price as of March 31, 2024 and 2023 \\nwould result in a pre-tax impact of ₹85.66 crores and ₹57.44 crores, respectively.\\n   (Note: The impact is indicated on equity before consequential tax impact, if any).\\n  (ii) Credit risk\\n    Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to \\nthe contractual terms or obligations. Credit risk encompasses both the direct risk of default and the risk of \\ndeterioration of creditworthiness as well as concentration risks.\\n    Financial instruments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk, principally consist of investments classified \\nas fair value through profit and loss, trade receivables, loans and derivative financial instruments. The Company \\nstrives to promptly identify and reduce concerns about collection due to a deterioration in the financial conditions \\nand others of its main counterparties by regularly monitoring their situation based on their financial condition. \\nNone of the financial instruments of the Company result in material concentrations of credit risks.\\n   Exposure to credit risk\\n   The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to \\ncredit risk was ₹13,378.09 crores and ₹10,346.83 crores as at March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, being the \\ntotal of the carrying amount of balances with banks, short term deposits with banks, trade receivables, finance \\nreceivables, margin money and other financial assets excluding equity investments.\\n   Financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired\\n   None of the Company’s cash equivalents, including short term deposits with banks, are past due or impaired. \\nRegarding trade receivables and other receivables, and other loans or receivables that are neither impaired \\nnor past due, there were no indications as at March 31, 2024, and March 31, 2023, that defaults in payment \\nobligations will occur.\\n79th Integrated Annual Report\\n2023-24\\n456'),\n",

TECHNOLOGY ABSORPTION, ADAPTATION AND \\nINNOVATIONS\\n 1. Efforts made towards technology absorption, adaptation and \\ninnovation:\\n  a. Joint R&D with Indian and foreign universities and \\nresearch institutes:\\n   Our company has a robust R&D in-house for technology \\nand product excellence. However, towards continued \\nexcellence in the ever-evolving tyre technology, we \\nwork on R&D projects with Institutions of eminence \\nin India and abroad. The projects cover a broad range \\nof comprehensive scientific understanding on the \\n‘interfaces and interphases’ of tyres, materials and \\ndesign aspects on the noise-vibration-harshness (NVH) \\naspects, exploration of novel- and sustainable materials \\n(bio-derived and circular), advancement of simulation \\ncapability, and nano- and nanostructured materials with \\nthe overall stated aim of the company to continuously \\nadvance green and sustainable tyre technologies. \\nThe joint R&D programs resulted in PhD degrees, \\ninternational publications and patents.  \\n  b. New product and material development, elimination of \\nhazardous materials, etc.:\\n   To improve sustainability of products, our company \\nis working on the multipronged 4R strategy of reduce, \\nrecycle, reuse and renewable. Our “Reduce” strategy \\nimplies achieving a reduction in the carbon footprint \\nduring the usage phase through a reduction in the rolling \\nresistance of tyres as well as a carbon footprint reduction \\nby ‘materials’ conservation’ through reduced usage of \\nraw materials (light-weighted tyres). The “Recycle” \\nstrategy involves promoting the usage of recycled \\nmaterials from waste and recovered materials from \\nend-of-life tyres as circular raw materials for new tyres. \\nThe focus of the “Reuse” methodology is on materials \\nand energy conservation through designing multiple \\nretreadable tyres and promoting the retreading process \\nby own networks, and the “Renewable” strategy implies \\nusage of sustainable raw materials from renewable \\nsources such as biomass. \\n   Towards import substitution, we have initiated joint \\ndevelopment programs with domestic suppliers for raw \\nmaterials such as sulphur, accelerators, antioxidants, \\nbutyl rubber, halobutyl rubber, microcrystalline wax, \\nsuper tackifier resin, performance resins, anti-reversion \\nagents, filler coupling / process agents, etc.\\n\\n21\\n  c. Key product developments:\\n   Our company has adopted sustainability as an integral \\npart of our business policy. We have improved the \\nshare of sustainable raw materials in all our tyres. To \\nmeet the emission norms under R117 and AIS 142 \\nstandards, we developed several low RR tyres which \\nhad been approved by Indian and global passenger car \\nOEMs. Similar activities are underway for tyres in the \\ncommercial vehicles as well.       \\n 2. Benefits derived as a result of the above efforts:\\n  The robust R&D programs, both in-house and the external, \\nresulted in knowledge and confidential information to the \\ncompany to maintain technological superiority in the market. \\nDevelopment of low rolling resistance tyres with an increased \\nshare of sustainable materials resulted in more sustainable \\ntyres. Efforts toward import substitution of raw materials \\nresulted in cost-saving and is a step towards the Atmanirbhar \\nBharat initiative of the Government of India.   \\n 3. Details of imported technology (imported during last 3 years \\nreckoned from the beginning of the financial year).\\n  No technology was imported during the last 3 years and MRF \\nis self-reliant on tyre technology for several decades.\\n 4.

Collaborations with entities like BCCI and Cricket Australia highlight its impact. The \\nfacilities available at the MRF Pace foundation are world-class. The Foundation hosts two training ground facilities, one at the Pachiyappa’s college, Chennai \\nand another at MCC Higher Secondary School, Chennai. The training ground at Pachiyappa’s college hosts full-fledged match scenario to test bowler’s skills \\nwith batsmen in real. The facility at the MCC Higher Secondary School, hosts a full-fledged cricket ground for centre cricket practice (nets facility).\\n\\n23\\n The Foundation’s representation in the IPL and future expansion plans underscore its continued success and influence.

World \\neconomy moved towards a soft landing with growth holding up and \\ninflation declining. MRF continued its industry leading growth in the \\ndomestic market.\\nEconomic growth was steady during the year despite monetary tightening, \\nwarnings of recession and impact of climate related events. Global trade \\nwas muted with increased geo economic fragmentation, trade restrictions \\nand lower consumption arising from tight financial conditions. Emerging \\neconomies performed better than the developed world. There was \\nsteady reduction in inflation in both developed and emerging economies \\nprompting Central Banks to pause interest rate hikes, though inflation is still \\nabove the target in most economies. Geo political issues continued causing \\ndisturbance to the world with the continuing Ukraine war, tensions in West \\nAsia and disturbances to commercial shipping in the Red Sea.\\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates show that World Economy \\ngrew by 3.2% in calendar year 2023 bettering its own earlier estimates. \\nIMF estimates that growth in 2024 would be similar to 2023. Inflation \\nis expected to decline steadily.Geopolitical disturbances could impact \\ninflation trajectory and delay central Bank policy easing, with adverse \\neffects on global growth. Rate cuts by Central Banks is now expected to \\nbe in the 2nd half of 2024.\\nMarket & Industry Overview\\nGrowth surprised on the upside for Indian economy over the quarters, \\ndriven by investment. Despite a difficult external sector and weakness in \\nagriculture arising from a patchy monsoon, Indian economy performed \\nwell riding on the strength of its domestic demand. Government of India’s \\nadvance estimates of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for 2023-24 shows a \\ngrowth at 7.6%. India continued to remain the fastest growing economy. \\nGrowth was led by manufacturing and construction. \\nPrivate consumption was weak as in the previous year, owing to lower \\nrural demand while urban demand was robust. There are early signs that \\nprivate investment is picking up, responding to growth in the economy. \\nIndia’s merchandise exports declined by 3% while total exports, including \\nservices, was at the same level as the previous year. Geo political issues \\nand weakened consumer demand impacted exports. But trade deficit was \\nlower by more than 9% as imports too contracted. Exports of electronics \\nwere a bright spot. \\nNon-food Inflation fell by 2.5% during the year (April,2023 to \\nJanuary,2024) while food inflation rose by 0.40% in the same period. \\nIndia has managed to deliver on both growth and inflation management.  \\nThe Government struck to the path of fiscal consolidation in the vote on \\naccount that was presented. Continuing with the thrust on capex, capital \\nexpenditure outlay was hiked by 11%. \\nIndian Government securities is set to be included in the emerging markets \\nbond index by Morgan Stanley and other financial institutions, reflecting \\nconfidence in the India growth story and the financial system. This move \\npaves the way for dollar inflows into the country’s sovereign debt market \\nand reduction of borrowing costs in the economy.  \\nIndia Meteorological Department (IMD) has projected an above normal \\nmonsoon for the year which should improve rural growth and consumption. \\nGrowth in financial year 2023-2024 came from Government spending \\nand high end consumption with only a marginal growth in agriculture. \\nA good monsoon should add to the growth of the economy in financial \\nyear 2024-25. Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has projected financial year \\n2024-25 GDP growth at 7% while IMF has projected the same at 6.8%.  \\nGlobal car sales grew by 10% in calendar year 2023 after a flat growth \\nin 2022. Electric car sales grew more than a third. Adoption of Electric \\nVehicles (EV) continued across markets. High vehicle costs and high \\ninterest rates were a pain point for the Industry. \\nIndian automobile industry performed well in financial year 2024 with \\ndomestic sales showing a growth of 12.5% (source: Society of Indian \\nAutomobile Manufacturers (SIAM)). Passenger vehicle segment and two \\nwheeler segment led the growth while commercial vehicles managed \\nto grow only marginally. Tractors were a weak spot as irregular rains \\nimpacted demand. In the passenger segment, share of entry level vehicles \\ncontinued to shrink. Demand revival was seen for entry level two wheelers \\nduring festive season and also in the last quarter of financial year 2023-24.\\n\\n41\\nHowever, exports were weak with many markets facing geo political and \\nmonetary issues.  There was sizeable drop in sales in commercial vehicles, \\ntwo wheelers and three wheelers while export of passenger vehicles grew \\nmarginally (source: SIAM). \\nThe production of Medium and Heavy Commercial Vehicle (M&HCV) \\nduring the year has seen a very marginal growth. The bus sales that was \\nimpacted during the Covid period is bouncing back. The trailer segment \\nis also seeing a growth every year fuelled by loading restrictions in many \\nmarkets. Electric vehicles have till now been predominantly in the bus \\nsegment operated by the state transport undertakings. Various regulatory \\nnorms are expected to be implemented during the year 2024-25 and \\nthe Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEMs) have been gearing up for \\nthe same. As a result of this, the tyre performance criteria of OEMs have \\nundergone considerable changes. \\nQuite a few new products were launched by us both in the bias and radial \\nsegment. This has helped us further consolidate our position with both the \\nOEM and in after sales markets.\\nThe current indications are that the first half of 2024-25 would be sluggish \\nand even with an anticipated recovery in the second half, the OEM \\nproduction is expected to continue to be flat if not marginally negative.  \\nThe passenger vehicle production has seen a growth of 7% in the year \\nended March,2024. Domestic  sales also recorded  yet again the highest \\never sale in a financial year. The segment continued to witness preference \\nfor Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs), which has now a share of more \\nthan 50% in overall sales. Despite price increases, better supplies and \\nsustained consumer demand, especially for SUVs, supported sales. The \\nwaiting period for many car models have come down and the stocks have \\nimproved in the dealerships. The shift to electric vehicle has intensified \\nfew years ago and continues this year as well.\\nTwo wheeler production showed growth for the second consecutive \\nyear. Motorcycle and scooter production saw good growth during the \\nyear. However, it is yet to reach the pre-Covid levels. In motorcycles, \\nthe 125 cc and above segment is showing a higher growth in production \\nand currently accounts for more than a third of the total production. A \\nslew of product launches by various OEMs were seen in the segment with \\nhigher cubic capacity (cc).  Growth has been fuelled by domestic sales \\nand exports continues to be sluggish. The year also saw the entry of one of \\nthe prominent OEMs into the 100 cc motorcycle segment.  \\nYour Company continues to be a preferred choice of fitment of OEMs \\nin most of their new launches. Many OEMs increased their fitment of \\nour tyres on their existing models also. During the year, the Company \\nlaunched ‘W’ rated Steel belted motorcycle radial tyres for the high \\nperformance segment, under the brand name ‘Steel Brace’. The Company \\nhas also further strengthened its after market portfolio with new products \\nboth in the motorcycle and scooter segment. \\nDuring the year, the government reduced the subsidies under the FAME 2 \\nscheme for electric vehicles which had a short-term impact on their sales. \\nSubsequently the tenure of the FAME 2 scheme also ended in March,2024. \\nThe new Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme has been announced for the \\nperiod 1st April, 2024 to 30th July, 2024.\\nTractor Production had shown a decline of 11% in the financial year \\n2023-24. A trend was observed among Tractor OEMs of bringing out \\nnewer lower HP and light weight tractor models. Tractor OEMs have \\nstarted planning for electric tractors in the near term. During the year, \\nthe Company was able to improve and consolidate its market share in \\nTractor OEMs. Farm mechanization is growing in India, with increased \\nusage of laser leveller, rotavators, reapers, paddy transplanters and \\nharvesters among farmers. This can lead to significant usage of higher \\nHP tractors in India in the near future. In the replacement segment, your \\nCompany continues to be the most preferred brand in the market place. \\nReplacement sales had shown considerable buoyancy this year. IMD has \\nforecasted an above normal monsoon during the coming season which \\nwould help revive the farming sector in financial year 2024-25. \\nTyre Industry posted a moderate growth in the financial year 2023-24 \\nin comparison to the previous year. Recovery in the second half of the \\nyear helped Exports to retain previous year’s figures. Further, lower raw \\nmaterial prices enabled the industry to show improved profit margins.\\nProduct wise Performance\\nDuring fiscal 2023-24, your Company achieved a total income of ` 24,986 \\ncrores. There was an increase in production across all Product Groups, \\nexcept Farm. In the heavy commercial vehicle product group, there was\\n\\n42\\nan increase of 9% over the previous year while light commercial vehicle \\ntyres increased by around 10%. Small commercial vehicle tyres increased \\nby 12%. Passenger & SUV showed a growth of 3%. The farm product \\ngroup de-grew by 6%. The motorcycle and scooter product group grew \\nby 17% and 21% respectively. The Off the Road (OTR) product group \\ngrew by 13%.\\nExports\\nExports business for the year 2023-24 grew in many of the key markets. \\nHowever, the overall growth was dragged down due to unfavourable \\nregulatory restrictions and a severe shortage of forex in few other markets. \\nTowards the latter half of the year, the Red Sea crisis impacted the global \\nshipping industry and led to a steep rise in ocean freights and container \\navailability, which also affected export shipments.\\nThe exports turnover for the year 2023-24 was Rs. 1874 crores as against \\n` 1866 crores the previous year.\\nMarkets in Far East and the African region showed resilience. In spite of \\nsevere price competition, the Company was able to maintain its volumes \\nand revenues in major markets. Categories of truck radial, light truck, farm, \\nOTR and 2 & 3 wheeler tyres showed good growth in these markets and \\nconsumer preferences continue to be high. Your Company also launched \\na range of farm radial tyres at the Agritechnica show in Hanover, Germany \\nin November, 2023. \\nIn the year ahead, the Company  will  focus on maintaining its growth \\nin our existing strong markets and substantially develop the emerging \\nmarkets.\\nDiscussion on Financial Performance with respect to Operational \\nPerformance\\n(` Crores)\\n 2023 - 2024 2022 - 2023\\nRevenue from operations 24674 22578\\nOther Income 312 248\\nTotal Income 24986 22826\\nProfit before tax 2739 1119\\nProvision for tax 698 303\\nProfit after tax 2041 816\\nThe revenue from operations of the Company for the 2023-2024 stood at \\nRs.24674 crores against Rs.22578 crores for the previous year ended 31st \\nMarch,2023.

Above average monsoon forecasted \\nshould improve rural demand and will be a tailwind for high growth in the \\neconomy. Inflation is moving towards RBI’s target of 4% even though food \\ninflation is sticky. Possible reduction in interest rates by RBI in the second \\nhalf would further aid growth and capital spend. Private sector capital \\ncapex should get a boost from demand increase and potential interest \\ncost reduction.\\nFood inflation has not shown a meaningful improvement in the last year. \\nExtreme weather events can keep food inflation elevated which may \\ninfluence RBI’s decision on interest rates. Geo political issues can cause \\nprice of Oil and other commodities to spike up.  In financial year 2024, \\nCorporates benefited from lower commodity prices. Commodity and \\nenergy prices have spiked in recent weeks.  \\nGrowth has so far been mainly driven by Government investments but \\nthe pace of public investments is set to slow as Government lowers its \\nfiscal deficit target. Sustaining of overall growth hinges on how private \\ninvestments pick up. Key things to look out for would be a broad based \\nimprovement in consumption growth and meaningful improvement in \\nprivate investment.       \\nOutlook\\nCommercial vehicles is likely to show muted growth in the current year. \\nGrowth of passenger vehicles may moderate considering the high base \\nand strong growth in the last 3 years. Industry body SIAM expects a 3 to \\n5% growth in financial year 2025. Two wheeler sales is showing signs of \\nimprovement and this may continue into the current year, considering \\nfavourable monsoon and likely improvement in rural demand. Capex \\nplans announced by leading auto companies point to higher levels of \\nproduction in the years to come. Impact on the tyre industry would also \\nbe similar as outlined above.   \\nInternal Control Systems and their Adequacy\\nYour Company has established internal control systems commensurate \\nwith the size and nature of business. It has put in place systems and \\ncontrols across the Company covering various financial and operational \\nfunctions. Company through its own Internal Audit Department carries \\nout periodical audits at various locations and functions based on the audit \\nplan as approved by the Audit Committee. Some of the salient features of \\nthe Internal control systems are:-\\n(i) An integrated ERP system connecting all plants, sales offices, head \\noffice, etc.\\n(ii) Systems and procedures are periodically reviewed to keep pace \\nwith the growing size and complexity of Company’s operations.\\n(iii) Assets are recorded and system put in place to safeguard against any \\nlosses or unauthorized disposal.\\n(iv) Periodic physical verification of fixed assets and Inventories.\\n(v) Key observations arising out of the Internal Audit are reviewed at the \\nAudit Committee meeting and follow up action taken.\\n\\n44\\nRisks and Concerns\\nGlobal economy continue to be affected by the geo political tensions, \\nbut the growth delivered was better than expected in the year gone by, \\ndespite monetary tightening, warnings of recession and impact of climate \\nrelated events. Geo political issues continued to pose for us micro and \\nmacro level economic structural challenges with the continuing Ukraine \\nwar, Israel-Iran tensions in West Asia and disturbances to commercial \\nshipping in the Red Sea. These could result in impacting demand both in \\nthe domestic and export markets. Moreover, climatic changes continue to \\naffect availability of natural rubber during the year resulting in increase \\nin natural rubber prices. Uncertainty remains with regard to the price of \\ncrude oil which also impacts the price of raw materials used by the tyre \\nIndustry. IMD has projected an above normal monsoon for the year which \\nshould improve rural growth and consumption. Key things to look out for \\nduring the year would be a broad based improvement in consumption \\ngrowth and meaningful improvement in private investment.

Opinion\\n We have audited the Separate financial statements (also known as \\nStandalone Financial Statements) of MRF Limited (“the Company”), \\nwhich comprise the Balance Sheet as at 31st March 2024,  the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive \\nIncome), Statement of Changes in Equity and Statement of Cash \\nFlows for the year ended on that date, and  a summary of material \\naccounting policies and other explanatory information.\\n In our opinion and to the best of our information and according \\nto the explanations given to us, the aforesaid Standalone Financial \\nStatements give the information required by the Companies Act, \\n2013 (“the Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and \\nfair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind \\nAS) prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with Companies \\n(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended and other \\naccounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of \\naffairs (financial position) of the Company as at 31st March 2024, \\nand its profit (financial performance including Other Comprehensive \\nIncome), the Changes in Equity and its Cash Flows for the year \\nended on that date.\\n2. Basis for Opinion\\n We conducted our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements \\nin accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified \\nunder Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those \\nStandards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for \\nthe Audit of the Standalone  Financial Statements section of our \\nreport. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the \\nCode of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of \\nIndia (ICAI) together with the independence requirements that are \\nrelevant to our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements under \\nthe provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have \\nfulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these \\nrequirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the \\naudit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to \\nprovide a basis for our audit opinion on the Standalone Financial \\nStatements.\\n3. Emphasis of Matter\\n We draw attention to Note 28((q(i)(a)) to the Standalone Financial \\nStatement which describe the following matter :\\n In terms of the Order dated 31st August 2018 the Competition \\nCommission of India (CCI) has on 2nd February 2022 released its \\nOrder imposing penalty on the Company concerning the breach of \\nprovisions of the Competition Act, 2002 during the year 2011-2012 \\nand imposed a penalty of ` 622.09 Crores on the Company.  The \\nappeal filed by the Company has been disposed of by the National \\nCompany Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in December 2022, by \\nremanding the matter to CCI for review after hearing the parties.  CCI \\nhas in February 2023 filed an appeal against the Order of NCLAT \\nbefore the Hon’ble Supreme Court. Pending disposal, the Company \\nhas filed an appeal before the Hon’ble Supreme Court against the \\norder of NCLAT, which has been tagged with the appeal filed by CCI \\nin the Supreme Court. The Company is of the view that no provision \\nis considered necessary in respect of this matter in the Standalone \\nFinancial Results.\\n Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\\n4. Key Audit Matters \\n Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional \\njudgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial \\nstatements of the current year. These matters were addressed in \\nthe context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and \\nin forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate \\nopinion on these matters.\\n\\n66\\nSr. \\nNo.\\nKey Audit Matter How the matter was addressed in our audit\\n1 Defined Benefit Obligation\\nThe valuation of the retirement benefit schemes in \\nthe Company is determined with reference to various \\nactuarial assumptions including discount rate, future \\nsalary increases, rate of inflation, mortality rates and \\nattrition rates. Due to the size of these schemes, small \\nchanges in these assumptions can have a material \\nimpact on the estimated defined benefit obligation\\nOur audit procedures included: \\nWe have examined the key controls over the process involving member data, formulation \\nof assumptions and the financial reporting process in arriving at the provision for retirement \\nbenefits.  We tested the controls for determining the actuarial assumptions and the approval \\nof those assumptions by senior management. We found these key controls were designed, \\nimplemented and operated effectively, and therefore determined that we could place reliance \\non these key controls for the purposes of our audit.\\nWe tested the employee data used in calculating the obligation and  where material, we also \\nconsidered the treatment of curtailments, settlements, past service costs, remeasurements, \\nbenefits paid, and any other amendments made to obligations during the year. From the evidence \\nobtained, we found the data and assumptions used by management in the actuarial valuations \\nfor retirement benefit obligations to be appropriate.\\n2\\nProvision for Sales related obligations\\nThe Company makes an estimated provision for \\nsales related obligations based on commitments, \\nestablished trade practices, historical trends and \\nother assumptions which are judgemental including \\nthose relating to outflow of resources.\\nConsidering the significant judgements involved in \\nmaking the above estimate, we have considered this \\nas a key audit matter. \\nOur audit procedures included: \\nWe understood and tested the controls over the assumptions applied in arriving at the provision \\nfor Sales related obligations.  \\nTested on sample basis, the provision made during the year with relevant data elements, \\nassumptions involved,  validation of formula used in the spread sheet and  management review \\nand control of the relevant internal and external factors impacting the provision.\\n3 Provision for Extended Producer Responsibility \\n(EPR)\\n(Refer Note 28 j) \\nThe Company has recognised provision towards EPR \\nobligations based on the notification issued by the \\nMinistry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.  \\nThe obligation is to be met by purchasing certificates \\nfrom Recyclers and the provision is estimated based \\non current cost estimate.  \\nGiven the inherent complexity and the magnitude of \\nthe potential exposures and judgements necessary \\nto estimate the amount of provision required and to \\ndetermine required disclosures, we have considered \\nthis as a key audit matter.\\nOur audit procedures included: \\nWe have obtained an understanding on the requirement of the notification and of the process \\nfollowed by the Company for assessment and determination of the amount of provision required \\n/ recognized and the appropriateness of the disclosures made in the financial statements.\\n\\n67\\nSr. \\nNo.\\nKey Audit Matter How the matter was addressed in our audit\\n4 Litigation, Claims and Contingent Liabilities\\n(Refer Note 28(q), to be read along with Emphasis of \\nmatter in Independent Auditor’s Report) \\nThe Company is exposed to variety of different \\nlaws, regulations and interpretations thereof.  \\nConsequently, in the normal course of business, \\nProvisions and Contingent Liabilities may arise from \\nlegal proceedings, constructive obligations and \\ncommercial claims.\\n•\\t Management\\t applies\\t significant\\t

Information other than the Standalone Financial Statements and \\nAuditor’s Report thereon\\n The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation \\nof the other information.  The other information comprises the \\ninformation included in the Board’s Report including Annexures to \\nBoard’s Report, Management Discussion and Analysis, Report on \\nCorporate Governance, Business Responsibility and Sustainability \\nReport, but does not include the Standalone Financial Statements \\nand our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the Standalone \\nFinancial Statements does not cover the other information and we \\ndo not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\\n In connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements, \\nour responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, \\nconsider whether the other information is materially inconsistent \\nwith the Standalone Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained \\nduring the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially \\nmisstated.\\n If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is \\na material misstatement of this other information, we are required to \\nreport that fact.  We have nothing to report in this regard.\\n6. Management’s Responsibility for the Standalone Financial \\nStatements \\n The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters \\nstated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation \\nof these Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair \\nview of the financial position, financial performance including \\nother comprehensive income, changes in Equity and Cash Flows of \\nthe Company in accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting \\nprinciples generally accepted in India. This responsibility also \\nincludes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance \\nwith the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of \\nthe Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other \\nirregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting \\npolicies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and \\nprudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate \\ninternal financial controls, that were operating effectively for \\nensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, \\nrelevant to the preparation and presentation of the Standalone \\nFinancial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from \\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\\n In preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, management is \\nresponsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a \\ngoing concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going \\nconcern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless \\nmanagement either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease \\noperations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\\n The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Company’s \\nfinancial reporting process.\\n7. Auditor’s Responsibility for the audit of the Standalone Financial \\nStatements\\n Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether \\nthe Standalone Financial Statements as a whole are free from \\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue \\nan auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance \\nis a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit \\nconducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material \\nmisstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or \\nerror and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, \\nthey could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \\ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone  Financial \\nStatements.\\n As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional \\njudgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the \\naudit.  We also:\\n\\t •\\t Identify\\t and\\tassess\\tthe\\trisks\\tof\\tmaterial\\tmisstatement\\tof\\tthe\\t\\nStandalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or \\nerror, design and perform audit procedures responsive to \\nthose risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and \\nappropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of \\nnot detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is \\nhigher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve\\n\\n69\\ncollusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, \\nor the override of internal control.\\n\\t •\\t Obtain\\t an\\tunderstanding\\tof\\tinternal\\tfinancial\\tcontrols\\trelevant\\t\\nto the audit in order to design audit procedures that are \\nappropriate in the circumstances.  Under Section 143(3)(i) of \\nthe Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion \\non whether the Company has adequate internal financial \\ncontrols with reference to financial statements in place and \\nthe operating effectiveness of such controls.\\n\\t •\\t Evaluate\\t the\\t appropriateness\\t of\\t accounting\\t policies\\t used\\t\\nand the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related \\ndisclosures made by the management.\\n\\t •\\t Conclude\\t on\\tthe\\tappropriateness\\tof\\tmanagement’s\\tuse\\tof\\tthe\\t\\ngoing concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit \\nevidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists \\nrelated to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt \\non the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If we \\nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to \\ndraw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures \\nin the Standalone Financial Statements or, if such disclosures \\nare inadequate, to modify our opinion.

MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITy FOR INTERNAL FINANCIAL \\nCONTROLS\\n The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and \\nmaintaining internal financial controls with reference to Standalone \\nFinancial Statements based on the internal financial controls with \\nreference to Standalone Financial Statements criteria established \\nby the Company considering the essential components of internal \\ncontrol stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial \\nControls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of \\nChartered Accountants of India (ICAI).

MEANING OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROL WITH \\nREFERENCE TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n A Company’s internal financial control with reference to Standalone \\nFinancial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable \\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and \\nthe preparation of financial statements for external purposes in \\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A \\nCompany’s internal financial control with reference to Standalone \\nFinancial Statements includes those policies and procedures \\nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable \\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions \\nof the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance \\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation \\nof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted \\naccounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the \\nCompany are being made only in accordance with authorisations \\nof management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide \\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of \\nunauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s \\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\n5. INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS \\nWITH REFERENCE TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls \\nwith reference to Standalone Financial Statements, including \\nthe possibility of collusion or improper management override of \\ncontrols, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur \\nand not be detected.

These policies \\nhave been consistently applied to all the years presented.\\n i. Statement of Compliance\\n  These Separate Financial Statements (also known as \\nStandalone Financial Statements) have been prepared in \\naccordance with IND AS as prescribed under Section 133 of \\nthe Companies Act, 2013 read with Rule 3 of the Companies \\n(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and subsequent \\namendments thereto.\\n ii. Basis of preparation and presentation\\n  The Financial Statements have been prepared on historical \\ncost basis considering the applicable provisions of Companies \\nAct 2013, except for the following material item that has \\nbeen measured at fair value as required by relevant Ind AS. \\nHistorical cost is generally based on the fair value of the \\nconsideration given in exchange for goods and services.\\n  a) Certain financial assets/liabilities measured at fair value \\n(Refer Note 1 (C 10)) and\\n  b) Any other item as specifically stated in the accounting \\npolicy. (Refer Note 28 (f)) \\n  The Financial Statement are presented in INR and all values \\nare rounded off to Rupees Crores unless otherwise stated.\\n  The Company reclassifies comparative amounts, unless \\nimpracticable and whenever the Company changes the \\npresentation or classification of items in its Financial \\nStatements materially. No such material reclassification has \\nbeen made during the year.\\n  The Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended \\n31st March, 2024 were authorised for issue in accordance \\nwith a resolution of the directors on 03rd May, 2024.\\n iii. Major Sources of Estimation Uncertainty \\n  In the application of accounting policy which are described in \\nnote (C) below, the management is required to make judgment, \\nestimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets \\nand liabilities, income and expenses, contingent liabilities and \\nthe accompanying disclosures that are not readily apparent \\nfrom other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions \\nare based on historical experience and other factors that are \\nconsidered to be relevant and are prudent and reasonable.  \\nActual results may differ from those estimates. The estimates \\nand underlying assumptions are reviewed on ongoing basis. \\nRevisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period \\nin which the estimates are revised if the revision affects only \\nthat period or in the period of revision and future periods if the \\nrevision affects both current and future period.\\n  The few critical estimations and judgments made in applying \\naccounting policies are:\\n Property, Plant and Equipment/Intangible Assets:\\n Useful life of Property, Plant and Equipment are as specified in \\nSchedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 and on certain intangible \\nassets based on technical advice which considered the nature of \\nthe asset, the usage of the asset, expected physical wear and tear,\\n\\n89\\nthe operating conditions of the asset, anticipated technological \\nchanges, manufacturers warranties and maintenance support. The \\nCompany reviews the useful life of Property, Plant and Equipment \\nand intangible assets at the end of each reporting period. This \\nreassessment may result in change in depreciation charge in future \\nperiods (Refer Note 1 (C 1)).\\n Impairment of Non-financial Assets:\\n For calculating the recoverable amount of non-financial assets, the \\nCompany is required to estimate the value-in-use of the asset or the \\nCash Generating Unit and the fair value less costs to disposal. For \\ncalculating value in use the Company is required to estimate the \\ncash flows to be generated from using the asset. The fair value of \\nan asset is estimated using a valuation technique where observable \\nprices are not available. Further, the discount rate used in value in \\nuse calculations includes an estimate of risk assessment specific to \\nthe asset. \\n Impairment of Financial Assets:\\n The Company impairs financial assets other than those measured \\nat fair value through profit or loss or designated at fair value \\nthrough other comprehensive income on expected credit losses. \\nThe estimation of expected credit loss includes the estimation \\nof probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and the \\nexposure at default (EAD). Estimation of probability of default apart \\nfrom involving trend analysis of past delinquency rates includes an \\nestimation on forward-looking information relating to not only the \\ncounterparty but also relating to the industry and the economy as a \\nwhole. The probability of default is estimated for the entire life of the \\ncontract by estimating the cash flows that are likely to be received \\nin default scenario. The lifetime PD is reduced to 12 months PD \\nbased on an assessment of past history of default cases in 12 months. \\nFurther, the loss given default is calculated based on an estimate of \\nthe value of the security recoverable as on the reporting date. The \\nexposure at default is the amount outstanding at the balance sheet \\ndate (Refer Note 1(C 10)).\\n Defined Benefit Plans:\\n The cost of the defined benefit plan and other post-employment \\nbenefits and the present value of such obligations are determined \\nusing actuarial valuations.  An actuarial valuation involves making \\nvarious assumptions that may differ from actual developments in \\nthe future.  These include the determination of the discount rate, \\nfuture salary increases, mortality rates and attrition rate.  Due to \\nthe complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, \\na defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these \\nassumptions.  All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date \\n(Refer Note 28 (f)).\\n Fair Value Measurement of Financial Instruments:\\n When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities \\nrecorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted \\nprices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation \\ntechniques including the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model.  The \\ninputs to these models are taken from observable markets where \\npossible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is \\nrequired in establishing fair values (Refer Note 1 (C10)).\\n Income Taxes:\\n Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision for \\nincome taxes, including amount expected to be paid/recovered for \\nuncertain tax positions (Refer Note 1 (C 9)).\\n In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, \\nmanagement considers whether some portion or all of the deferred \\nincome tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of \\ndeferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future \\ntaxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences \\nbecome deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals \\nof deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income \\nand tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the \\nlevel of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable \\nincome over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are \\ndeductible, management believes that the Company will realize the \\nbenefits of those deductible differences. The amount of the deferred\\n\\n90\\nincome tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced \\nin the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the \\ncarry forward period are reduced.\\n Leases:\\n Ind AS 116 requires lessees to determine the lease term as the non-\\ncancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend or \\nterminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. \\nThe Company makes an assessment on the expected lease term on \\na lease-by-lease basis and thereby assesses whether it is reasonably \\ncertain that any options to extend or terminate the contract will be \\nexercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Company considers \\nfactors such as any significant leasehold improvements undertaken \\nover the lease term, costs relating to the termination of the lease \\nand the importance of the underlying asset to Company’s operations \\ntaking into account the location of the underlying asset and the \\navailability of suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods \\nis reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the current \\neconomic circumstances. After considering current and future \\neconomic conditions, the Company concludes that no changes are \\nrequired to lease period relating to the existing lease contracts (Refer \\nNote 1 (C 4)).\\n Allowance for credit losses on receivables:\\n The Company determines the allowance for credit losses based on \\nhistorical loss experience adjusted to reflect current and estimated \\nfuture economic conditions. The Company considered current \\nand anticipated future economic conditions relating to industries \\nthe Company deals with and the countries where it operates. In \\ncalculating expected credit loss, the Company has also considered \\ncredit reports and other related credit information for its customers \\nto estimate the probability of default in future. \\nC) Summary of Material Accounting Policies\\n Ind AS 1 was amended vide notification no G.S.R.242(E) dated \\n31st March 2023 to require disclosure of Material Accounting \\nPolicy information from accounting periods beginning on or after \\n1 April 2023 instead of significant accounting policy disclosure \\nby amending paragraph 117, inserting paragraphs 117A to 117E \\nand deleting paragraphs 118 to 121. Paragraph 117 of Ind AS 1 \\nstates when an information on accounting policy is considered as \\n‘Material Accounting Policy information’ as follows:\\n Accounting policy information is material if, when considered \\ntogether with other information included in an entity’s financial \\nstatements, it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions that \\nthe primary users of general-purpose financial statements make on \\nthe basis of those financial statements.\\n Each of the policy disclosed herein below has been tested to \\ndetermine whether the information disclosed is Material Accounting \\nPolicy information.\\n 1) Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE):\\n  The Company has elected to continue with the carrying value \\nof Property, Plant and Equipment (‘PPE’) recognised as of the \\ntransition date, measured as per the Previous GAAP and use \\nthat carrying value as its deemed cost.\\n  Property, Plant and Equipment are stated at cost less \\naccumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment \\nlosses except for freehold land which is not amortised. Any \\ngain or loss arising on derecognition of an item of property, \\nplant and equipment is determined as the difference between \\nthe net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset \\nand is recognized in profit or loss with other income or other \\nexpense line item on net basis, respectively.\\n  The depreciable amount of an asset is determined after \\ndeducting its residual value.  Depreciation on the property, \\nplant and equipment, is provided over the useful life of assets \\nbased on management estimates which is in line with the \\nuseful life indicated in Schedule II to the Companies Act, \\n2013. Depreciation on all assets except Renewable Energy \\nSaving Devices is provided on straight line basis whereas \\ndepreciation on renewable energy saving devices is provided \\non reducing balance basis. Given below are the estimated \\nuseful lives for each class of property, plant and equipment:\\n\\n91\\nDescription of the Asset Estimated Useful life(On \\nSingle shift working)\\nTangible (Owned Assets) :\\nBuilding –  Factory\\n  –  Other than factory buildings\\n30 Years\\n60 Years  \\nPlant and Equipment 5-21 Years\\nMoulds 6 Years\\nFurniture and Fixtures  5 Years\\nComputer Servers 5 Years\\nComputers 3 Years\\nOffice Equipment 5 Years\\nOther Assets, viz., Electrical Fittings, Fire \\nFighting/Other Equipments and Canteen \\nUtensils\\n8-10 Years\\nRenewable Energy Saving Device – \\nWindmills\\n22 Years\\nVehicles 5 Years\\nAircraft 10 and 20 Years\\nRight of Use Assets (Leased Assets) :\\n- Buildings-Other than factory buildings 1-21 Years\\n- Vehicles 2 Years\\n- Land – Leasehold Primary period of lease\\nIntangible(Owned Assets):  \\nSoftware 5 Years\\n 2) Intangible Assets:\\n  Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial \\nrecognition at cost. After initial recognition, intangible assets \\nare carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and \\naccumulated impairment losses. \\n  Software (not being an integral part of the related hardware) \\nacquired for internal use are treated as intangible assets. \\n  Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of an intangible \\nasset is determined as the difference between the net \\ndisposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and \\nis recognized in profit or loss with other income or other \\nexpense line item on net basis, respectively. \\n  Intangible Assets are amortised over 5 years on straight-line \\nmethod over the estimated useful economic life of the assets.\\n  The Company undertakes Research and Development \\nactivities for development of new and improved products. \\nThe Company recognises all expenditure incurred during the \\nresearch phase in the profit or loss whereas the expenditure \\nincurred in development phase are presented as Intangible \\nAssets under Development till the time they are available for \\nuse in the manner intended at which moment they are treated \\nas Intangible Assets and amortised over their estimated useful \\nlife.\\n 3) Inventories:\\n  Inventories consisting of stores and spares, raw materials, Work \\nin progress, Stock in Trade and finished goods are measured \\nat lower of cost and net realisable value. However, materials \\nheld for use in production of inventories are not written down \\nbelow cost, if the finished products are expected to be sold at \\nor above cost.\\n  The cost is computed on FIFO basis except for stores and \\nspares which are on daily moving Weighted Average Cost \\nbasis. \\n  Inventory obsolescence is based on assessment of the future \\nuses. Obsolete and slow-moving items are subjected to \\ncontinuous technical monitoring.\\n 4) Leases:\\n  The Company as a lessee\\n  The Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases \\nfor land, buildings and vehicles. The Company assesses \\nwhether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract.\\n\\n92\\n  At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company \\nrecognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding \\nlease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, \\nexcept for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-\\nterm leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and \\nlow value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments \\nas an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term \\nof the lease.\\n  Lease term includes extension or termination options when it \\nis reasonably certain that they will be exercised.\\n  The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost and \\nsubsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation \\nand impairment losses.\\n  Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement \\ndate on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term \\nand useful life of the underlying asset. \\n  The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of \\nthe future lease payments. The lease payments are discounted \\nusing the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily \\ndeterminable, using the incremental borrowing rates. Lease \\nliabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the \\nrelated right of use asset if the Company changes its assessment \\nof whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option.\\n 5) Government Grants:\\n  The grant relating to export benefits is presented under other \\nincome on a systematic basis in the Profit or Loss over the \\nperiods necessary to match them with the related costs, which \\nthey are intended to compensate. Subsidies received from State \\nGovernment are presented under other operating income. \\nWhere the grant relates to an asset under EPCG Scheme, it \\nis presented as a deferred income aggregated under other \\nliabilities in Balance Sheet and presented under other income in \\nequal amounts over the expected useful life of the related asset. \\nWhere the assets have been fully depreciated with no future \\nrelated cost, the grant is recognised in profit or loss.\\n  When loans or similar assistance are provided by governments \\nor related institutions, with an interest rate below the current \\napplicable market rate, the effect of this favourable interest \\nis regarded as a government grant.  The loan or assistance \\nis initially recognised and measured at fair value and the \\ngovernment grant is measured as the difference between the \\ninitial carrying value of the loan and the proceeds received.  \\nThe loan is subsequently measured as per the accounting \\npolicy applicable to financial liabilities in respect of loans/\\nassistance received subsequent to the date of transition.\\n 6) Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets:\\n  Provisions are recognized when there is a present legal or \\nconstructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is \\nprobable (i.e. more likely than not) that an outflow of resources \\nembodying economic benefits will be required to settle the \\nobligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount \\nof the obligation.  \\n  Provision for separate sales related obligations is made for \\nprobable future claims on sales effected and are estimated \\nbased on previous claim experience on a scientific basis.  This \\nprovision is revised annually.\\n  Contingent liabilities are disclosed on the basis of judgment \\nof management / independent experts.  These are reviewed at \\neach balance sheet date and are adjusted to reflect the current \\nmanagement estimate.\\n 7) Revenue Recognition:\\n  The Company derives revenues primarily from sale of goods \\ncomprising of Automobile Tyres, Tubes, Flaps and Tread \\nRubber. \\n  Revenue from contract with customers is recognised upon \\ntransfer of control of promised products or services to \\ncustomers in an amount that reflects the consideration the \\nCompany expects to receive in exchange for those products or \\nservices.\\n\\n93\\n  Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised at the point in \\ntime when control is transferred to the customer.\\n  Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance obligation \\nis measured at the amount of transaction price allocated to \\nthat performance obligation. The transaction price of goods \\nsold and services rendered is net of variable consideration \\non account of turnover/product/prompt payment discounts \\nand schemes offered by the Company as part of the contract \\nwith the customers.  When the level of discount varies with \\nincrease in levels of revenue transactions, the Company \\nrecognises the liability based on its estimate of the customer’s \\nfuture purchases using expected value method. The Company \\nrecognises changes in the estimated amounts of obligations \\nfor discounts in the period in which the change occurs. The \\nCompany considers certain other commitments in the contract \\nthat are separate sales related performance obligations and \\nclaims preferred during the year against such contractual \\nobligations are netted off from Revenue, consistent with its \\ncurrent practice. Revenue also excludes taxes collected from \\ncustomers.\\n  Revenue in excess of invoicing is classified as contract assets \\nwhile invoicing in excess of revenues are classified as contract \\nliabilities.\\n  Use of significant judgements in Revenue Recognition :\\n\\t \\t •\\t \\tJudgement\\tis\\trequired\\tto\\tdetermine\\tthe\\ttransaction\\tprice\\t\\nfor the contract.  The transaction price could be either a \\nfixed amount of consideration or variable consideration \\nwith elements such as turnover/product/prompt payment \\ndiscounts. Any consideration payable to the customer is \\nadjusted to the transaction price, unless it is a payment \\nfor a distinct product or service from the customer. The \\nestimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted \\nin the transaction price only to the extent that it is highly \\nprobable that a significant reversal in the amount of \\ncumulative revenue recognised will not occur and is \\nreassessed at the end of each reporting period.\\n\\t \\t •\\t The\\t Company\\t exercises\\t judgement\\t in\\t determining\\t\\nwhether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point \\nin time or over a period of time. The Company considers \\nindicators such as how customer consumes benefits \\nas services are rendered or who controls the asset as \\nit is being created or existence of enforceable right to \\npayment for performance to date and alternate use of \\nsuch product or service, transfer of significant risks and \\nrewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the \\ncustomer.  \\n 8) Employee Benefits:\\n  a) Short term Employee Benefits:\\n   All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve \\nmonths of rendering services are classified as short-term \\nemployee benefits. Benefits such as salaries, wages, \\nshort-term compensated absences and performance \\nincentives, are recognised during the period in which \\nthe employee renders related services and are measured \\nat undiscounted amount expected to be paid when the \\nliabilities are settled.\\n  b) Long Term Employee Benefits:\\n   The cost of providing long term employee benefit \\nsuch as earned leave is measured as the present value \\nof expected future payments to be made in respect of \\nservices provided by employees upto the end of the \\nreporting period.  The expected costs of the benefit \\nis accrued over the period of employment using the \\nsame methodology as used for defined benefits post \\nemployment plans. Actuarial gains and losses arising \\nfrom the experience adjustments and changes in \\nactuarial assumptions are charged or credited to profit \\nor loss section of the Statement of Profit or Loss in the \\nperiod in which they arise except those included in cost \\nof assets as permitted. The benefit is measured annually \\nby independent actuary.\\n\\n94\\n  c) Post Employment Benefits:\\n   The Company provides the following post employment \\nbenefits:\\n   i) Defined benefit plans such as gratuity, trust \\nmanaged Provident Fund and post-retirement \\nmedical benefit (PRMB); and\\n   ii) Defined contribution plans such as provident \\nfund, pension fund and superannuation fund.\\n  d) Defined benefits Plans:\\n   The cost of providing benefits on account of gratuity \\nand post retirement medical benefits / obligations are \\ndetermined using the projected unit credit method on \\nthe basis of actuarial valuation made at the end of each \\nbalance sheet date.\\n   Re-measurements comprising of actuarial gains \\nand losses arising from experience adjustments and \\nchange in actuarial assumptions, the effect of change \\nin assets ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan \\nasset (excluding net interest) are recognised in other \\ncomprehensive income (OCI) except those included in \\ncost of assets as permitted in the period in which they \\noccur.  Re-measurements are not reclassified to the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss in subsequent periods.\\n   Eligible employees of the Company receive benefits \\nfrom a provident fund trust which is a defined benefit \\nplan. Both the eligible employee and the Company \\nmake monthly contributions to the provident fund \\nplan equal to a specified percentage of the covered \\nemployees salary. The Company contributes a part of \\nthe contribution to the provident fund trusts. The trusts \\ninvests in specific designated instruments as permitted \\nby Indian Law. The remaining portion is contributed to \\nthe Government Administered Pension Fund. The rate at \\nwhich the annual interest is payable to the beneficiaries \\nby the trusts is administered by the Government. The \\nCompany has obligation to make good the shortfall, if \\nany, between the return from investments of the Trusts \\nand the notified interest rate. However, as at the year-\\nend no shortfall remains unprovided for. \\n  e) Defined Contribution Plans\\n   Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit \\nplans, viz., Provident Fund for certain eligible \\nemployees, Pension Fund and Superannuation benefits \\nare recognised as an expense when employees have \\nrendered the service entitling them to the contribution.\\n 9) Taxes on Income:\\n  Income tax expense represents the sum of tax currently \\npayable and deferred tax.  Tax is recognised in the profit or \\nloss section of the Statement of Profit and Loss, except to the \\nextent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in \\nother comprehensive income.\\n  a) Current Tax:\\n   Current tax is the expected tax payable/ receivable on \\nthe taxable income/ loss for the year using applicable \\ntax rates for the relevant period, and any adjustment to \\ntaxes in respect of previous years. Interest expenses and \\npenalties, if any, related to income tax are included in \\nfinance cost and other expenses respectively. Interest \\nIncome, if any, related to Income tax is included in \\nOther Income.\\n  b) Deferred Tax:\\n   Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences \\nbetween the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities \\nin the balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases \\nused in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred \\ntax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary \\ndifferences. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all \\ndeductible temporary differences, unabsorbed losses \\nand unabsorbed depreciation  to the extent that it is\\n\\n95\\nprobable that future taxable profits will be available \\nagainst which those deductible temporary differences, \\nunabsorbed losses and unabsorbed depreciation can be \\nutilised. \\n 10) Financial Instruments:\\n  Financial Assets\\n  A financial asset inter-alia includes any asset that is cash, \\nequity instrument of another entity or contractual rights to \\nreceive cash or another financial asset or to exchange financial \\nasset or financial liability under condition that are potentially \\nfavourable to the Company.\\n  Investments in subsidiaries  \\n  Investments in equity shares of subsidiaries are carried at cost. \\n  Financial assets other than investment in subsidiaries  \\n  Financial assets of the Company comprise trade receivable, \\ncash and cash equivalents, Bank balances, Investments \\nin equity shares of companies other than in subsidiaries, \\nInvestment in units of Mutual Funds, loans/Debt instrument, \\nadvances to employee, related parties, others, security deposit, \\nclaims recoverable etc. \\n  Initial recognition and measurement\\n  All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in \\nthe case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through \\nprofit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the \\nacquisition of the financial asset. However, Trade receivables \\nthat do not contain a significant financing component are \\nmeasured at Transaction Price. Transaction costs of financial \\nassets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed \\nin profit or loss. \\n  Subsequent measurement\\n  For purposes of subsequent measurement financial assets are \\nclassified in three categories: \\n\\t \\t •\\t Financial\\tassets\\tmeasured\\tat\\tamortized\\tcost\\t\\n\\t \\t •\\t Financial\\t assets\\t at\\t fair\\t value\\t through\\t OCI\\t –\\t Debt\\t\\nInstruments \\n\\t \\t •\\t Financial\\tassets\\tat\\tfair\\tvalue\\tthrough\\tprofit\\tor\\tloss\\t\\n  Financial assets measured at amortized cost\\n  Bank deposits and Export benefits receivable are measured at \\namortised cost.  Financial assets are measured at amortized \\ncost if the financials asset is held within a business model \\nwhose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect \\ncontractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the \\nfinancial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that \\nare solely payments of principal and interest on the principal \\namount outstanding. These financials assets are amortized \\nusing the effective interest rate (EIR) method, less impairment. \\nAmortized cost is calculated by taking into account any \\ndiscount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are \\nan integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in \\nfinance income in the statement of profit and loss. \\n  Financial assets at fair value through OCI (FVTOCI)\\n  Investment in Debt instruments are measured at  FVTOCI.  \\nFinancial assets are mandatorily measured at fair value \\nthrough other comprehensive income if the financial asset is \\nheld within a business model whose objective is achieved by \\nboth collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial \\nassets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise \\non specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of \\nprincipal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. \\n  At initial recognition, an irrevocable election is made (on \\nan instrument-by-instrument basis) to designate investments \\nin equity instruments other than held for trading purpose \\nat FVTOCI. Fair value changes relating to financial assets \\nmeasured at FVTOCI are recognised in the other comprehensive \\nincome (OCI). On derecognition of the financial asset other \\nthan equity instruments, cumulative gain or loss previously \\nrecognised in OCI is reclassified to Profit or Loss.\\n\\n96\\n  Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)\\n  Any financial asset that does not meet the criteria for \\nclassification as at amortized cost or as financial assets at fair \\nvalue through other comprehensive income, is classified as \\nfinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss.\\n  Derecognition\\n  The Company derecognises a financial asset only when the \\ncontractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or \\nwhen it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the \\nrisks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. \\n  Impairment of financial assets\\n  The Company assesses impairment based on expected credit \\nloss (ECL) model on the following:\\n\\t \\t •\\t Financial\\tassets\\tthat\\tare\\tmeasured\\tat\\tamortised\\tcost.\\t\\n\\t \\t •\\t Financial\\t assets\\t(excluding\\tequity\\tinstruments)\\tmeasured\\t\\nat fair value through other comprehensive income \\n(FVTOCI).\\n   ECL is measured through a loss allowance on a following \\nbasis after considering the value of recoverable security:-  \\n\\t \\t •\\t The\\t 12\\tmonth\\texpected\\tcredit\\tlosses\\t(expected\\tcredit\\t\\nlosses that result from those default events on the \\nfinancial instruments that are possible within 12 months \\nafter the reporting date) \\n\\t \\t •\\t Full\\t life\\t time\\t expected\\t credit\\t losses\\t (expected\\t credit\\t\\nlosses that result from all possible default events over the \\nlife of financial instruments)\\n  The Company follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of \\nimpairment on trade receivables or contract assets resulting \\nfrom normal business transactions. The application of \\nsimplified approach does not require the Company to track \\nchanges in credit risk. However, it recognises impairment \\nloss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date,   \\nfrom the date of initial recognition.\\n  For recognition of impairment loss on other financial assets, \\nthe Company determines whether there has been a significant \\nincrease in the credit risk since initial recognition. If credit \\nrisk has increased significantly, lifetime ECL is provided. For \\nassessing increase in credit risk and impairment loss, the \\nCompany assesses the credit risk characteristics on instrument-\\nby-instrument basis.\\n  Impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognised during the \\nperiod is recognised as expense/income in profit and loss.\\n  Financial Liabilities\\n  The Company’s financial liabilities includes borrowings, \\ntrade payable, lease liabilities, accrued expenses and other \\npayables.\\n  Initial recognition and measurement\\n  All financial liabilities at initial recognition are classified as \\nfinancial liabilities at amortized cost or financial liabilities at \\nfair value through profit or loss, as appropriate. All financial \\nliabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the \\ncase of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly \\nattributable transaction costs.\\n  Financial Liabilities classified as Amortised Cost:\\n  All Financial Liabilities other than derivatives are measured at \\namortised cost. Interest expense that is not capitalised as part \\nof costs of assets is included as Finance costs in Profit or Loss.\\n  Derecognition\\n  A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation \\nunder the liability is discharged / cancelled / expired. When \\nan existing financial liability is replaced by another from the \\nsame lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an \\nexisting liability are substantially modified, such an exchange\\n\\n97\\nor modification is treated as the de recognition of the original \\nliability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference \\nin the respective carrying amounts is recognised in profit or \\nloss.\\n  Derivatives\\n  Derivative instruments are initially recognised at fair value \\non the date a derivative contract is entered into and are \\nsubsequently re-measured to their fair value at the end of each \\nreporting period.  The accounting for subsequent changes in \\nfair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as \\na hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being \\nhedged and the type of hedge relationship designated.  The \\nresulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately \\nunless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging \\ninstrument and is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income \\n(OCI). Cash flow hedges are reclassified to profit or loss as \\na reclassification adjustment in the same period or periods \\nduring which the hedged expected future cash flows affect \\nprofit or loss. If hedge of a forecast transaction results in the \\nrecognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, \\nthen the gain or loss that are accumulated in the cash flow \\nhedge reserve is recognised in the initial cost or other carrying \\namount of the asset or liability ( this is also referred to as “Basis \\nAdjustment”).\\nD) Recent accounting pronouncements:\\n Ministry of Corporate Affairs (‘MCA’) notifies new standards or \\namendments to the existing standards under Companies (Indian \\nAccounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. For the \\nyear ended 31st March, 2024, MCA has not notified any new \\nstandards or amendments to the existing standards applicable to the \\nCompany.\\n\\n98\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS AT 31ST MARCH 2024\\n(` Crores)\\nNOTE 2 (a) : Property,Plant and Equipment NOTE 2 (d) \\nINTANGIBLES\\nParticulars Land \\nFreehold\\nBuildings Plant and \\nequipment\\nFurniture \\nand \\nfixtures\\nVehicles Air Craft Office \\nequipment\\nComputers Moulds Other \\nAssets\\nTotal Computer \\n Software\\nGross Block\\nCarrying Value as at 31 March 2022  578.13  3168.87  9184.90  34.70  61.09  83.98  42.75  55.38  824.67  483.36 14517.83  58.73 \\nAdditions  2.70  384.16  949.86  3.67  11.39  -  5.50  15.20  158.81  41.01  1572.30  13.46 \\nDisposals   -  (0.02)  (73.06)  (1.60)  (3.28)  -  (3.24)  (5.29)  (56.95)  (4.25)  (147.69)  (0.60)\\nCarrying Value as at 31 March 2023  580.83  3553.01 10061.70  36.77  69.20  83.98  45.01  65.29  926.53  520.12 15942.44  71.59 \\nAdditions  23.21  604.28  2123.28  3.16  18.00  -  4.44  13.75  198.44  94.54  3083.10  9.74 \\nDisposals   (0.04)  (1.44)  (25.85)  (0.77)  (1.57)  -  (1.04)  (1.22)  (14.23)  (9.80)  (55.96)  - \\nCarrying Value as at 31 March 2024  604.00  4155.85 12159.13  39.16  85.63  83.98  48.41  77.82 1110.74  604.86 18969.58  81.33 \\nAccumulated depreciation /                            \\nAmortisation as at 31 March 2022\\n -  458.08  4179.53  21.64  30.60  22.15  30.36  40.08  466.70  269.60  5518.74  37.52 \\nDepreciation / Amortisation for the year  -  107.17  845.45  4.96  7.64  5.91  5.76  9.47  113.28  48.93  1148.57  8.73 \\nDisposals  -  (0.01)  (70.83)  (1.52)  (3.04)  -  (3.24)  (5.29)  (51.09)  (3.97)  (138.99)  (0.60)\\nAccumulated depreciation /                                 \\nAmortisation as at 31 March 2023\\n -  565.24  4954.15  25.08  35.20  28.06  32.88  44.26  528.89  314.56  6528.32  45.65 \\nDepreciation / Amortisation for the year -  122.42  965.56  4.77  8.61  5.91  5.09  10.93  125.78  50.31  1299.38  10.56 \\nDisposals -  (0.30)  (24.18)  (0.55)  (1.39) -  (1.04)  (1.22)  (14.06)  (9.34)  (52.08) -\\nAccumulated depreciation /                                 \\nAmortisation as at 31 March 2024\\n -  687.36  5895.53  29.30  42.42  33.97  36.93  53.97  640.61  355.53  7775.62  56.21 \\nNet Block\\nAs at 31 March 2023  580.83  2987.77  5107.55  11.69  34.00  55.92  12.13  21.03  397.64  205.56  9414.12  25.94 \\nAs at 31 March 2024  604.00  3468.49  6263.60  9.86  43.21  50.01  11.48  23.85  470.13  249.33 11193.96  25.12 \\nNote:\\n1.

Financial Risk Management\\n The Company’s principal financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, lease liability,trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial \\nliabilities is to finance the operations of the Company.  The principal financial assets include trade and other receivables, investments in mutual \\nfunds,bonds,cash and short term deposits.\\n\\n116\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST MARCH 2024\\n The Company has assessed market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk to its financial instruments.\\n i) Market Risk\\n  Is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a financial instrument, as a result of interest \\nrates, foreign exchange rates and other price risks. Financial instruments affected by market risks, primarily include loans & borrowings, investments \\nand foreign currency receivables, payables and borrowings.\\n  a) Interest Rate Risk : \\n   The Company borrows funds in Indian Rupees to meet both the long term and short term funding requirements. The Company due to its  \\nAAA rated status commands one of the cheapest source of funding.  Interest rate is fixed for the tenor of the Long term loans availed by the \\nCompany. Interest on Short term borrowings is subject to floating interest rate and are repriced regularly. The sensitivity analysis detailed \\nbelow have been determined based on the exposure to variable interest rates on the average outstanding amounts due to bankers over a \\nyear. The Company had issued floating interest rate Non convertible debenture linked to 6 month T-Bill rate, to meet the long term funding \\nrequirements. \\n   If the interest rates had been 1% higher / lower and all other variables held constant, the Company’s profit for the year ended 31st March, \\n2024 would have been decreased/increased by ` 8.14 Crores (Previous year - ` 10.66 Crores).\\n  b) Currency Risk : \\n   Foreign currency risks from financial instruments at the end of the reporting period expressed in INR :\\nUnhedged Short Term Exposures : (` Crores)\\n31.03.2024 31.03.2023\\nFinancial Assets/Other assets  193.53  199.27 \\nFinancial Liabilites/ Other Liabilities  324.21  179.76 \\n   The company is mainly exposed to changes in US Dollar. The sensitivity to a 0.74% (Previous year - 4.27%) increase or decrease in US Dollar \\nagainst INR with all other variables held constant will be +/( - )  ` 0.95 Crores (Previous year - ` 1.03 Crores).\\n   The Sensitivity analysis is prepared on the net unhedged exposure of the company at the reporting date.\\n   Hedged Foreign Currency exposures :\\n   Foreign Exchange forward Contracts on certain highly probable forecast transactions, are measured at fair value through OCI on being \\ndesignated as Cash Flow Hedges.\\n   The Company also enters into foreign exchange forward contracts with the intention to minimise the foreign exchange risk of expected \\npurchases, these contracts are not designated in hedge relationships and are measured at fair value through profit or loss.\\n\\n117\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST MARCH 2024\\n   The outstanding position and exposures are as under :\\n  i) Foreign Currency forward contracts designated as Hedge Instruments :\\nParticulars Currency Amount ` Crores Nature Cross \\nCurrency\\nForward Contract USD  99.06 Million  831.46 Import purchase INR\\n (101.68) Million  (844.11)\\nFigures in brackets are in respect of Previous year\\nThe terms of the foreign currency forward contracts match the terms of the transactions.

Due to the significantly increased volatility of certain commodities like \\nNatural Rubber, Synthetic Rubber, Compound Rubber and other Chemicals, the Company enters into purchase contracts on a short to medium \\nTerm and forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into to bring in stability of price fluctuations.\\n  The Company’s investments in Quoted and Unquoted Securities are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values \\nof investment securities. The Company manages the securities price risk through investments in debt funds and diversification by placing limits on \\nindividual and total investments. Reports on Investment Portfolio are reviewed on regular basis and all approvals of investment decisions are done \\nin concurrence with the senior management.  \\n  As at 31st March, 2024,  the investments in debt mutual funds and bonds amounts to ` 3366.16 Crores (Previous year - ` 3071.00 Crores). A 1% \\npoint increase or decrease in the NAV with all other variables held constant would have lead to approximately an additional ` 34 Crores (Previous \\nyear - ` 31 Crores) on either side in the statement of profit and loss.    \\nii) Credit Risk\\n Is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Company. It arises from credit exposure to \\ncustomers, financial instruments viz., Investments in Equity Shares, Bonds, Debt Funds, Fixed Deposits Others and Balances with Banks.\\n The Company’s marketing policies are well structured and all replacement sales are predominantly through dealers and the outstanding are secured by \\ndealer deposits.  As regards sales to O.E., and other institutional sales, the Company carries out periodic credit checks and also limits the exposure by \\nestablishing maximum payment period for customers and by offering prompt payment discounts. The outstanding trade receivables due for a period \\nexceeding 180 days as at the year ended 31st March, 2024 is 0.02% (31st March, 2023 0.02%) of the total trade receivables. \\n There are no transactions with single customer which amounts to 10% or more of the Company’s revenue. \\n The company uses Expected Credit Loss (ECL) Model to assess the impairment loss or gain. The allowance for lifetime ECL on customer balances for the \\nyear ended 31st March, 2024 was ` 1.63 Crores and for the previous year 31st March, 2023 was ` 2.08 Crores.\\n\\n119\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST MARCH 2024\\n(` Crores)\\nParticulars Year ended  \\n31.03.2024\\nYear ended  \\n31.03.2023\\nBalance at the beginning  2.08  2.08 \\nImpairment loss recognised  -  - \\nImpairment loss reversed  0.45  - \\nBalance at the end  1.63  2.08 \\n The Company holds cash and deposits with banks which are having highest safety rankings and hence has a low credit risk.\\n Investments in mutual funds are primarily debt funds, which have high safety ratings and are monitored on a monthly basis.The Company is of the \\nopinion that its mutual fund investments have low credit risk.\\niii) Liquidity Risk\\n The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate surplus, banking facilities and reserve borrowings facilities by continuously monitoring \\nforecasts and actual cash flows.\\n The Company has a system of forecasting rolling three months cash inflow and outflow and all liquidity requirements are planned.\\n All Long term borrowings are for a fixed tenor and generally these cannot be foreclosed.\\n The Company has access to various  source of Short term funding and debt maturing within 12 months can be rolled over with existing lenders/new \\nlenders, or repaid based on short term requirements.\\n Trade and other payables are plugged into the three months rolling cash flow forecast to ensure timely funding, if required.\\n All payments are made along due dates and requests for early payments are entertained after due approval and availing early payment discounts.\\n The details of the contractual maturities of significant financial liabilities as at 31st  March, 2024 are as under:\\n(` Crores)\\nParticulars Refer Note Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years\\nBorrowings Note  11 and 14  906.70 551.22  100.00  88.67 \\n (1153.50)  (452.22)  (299.99)  (88.67)\\nTrade Payable Note  15  2944.41  -  -  - \\n (2757.45)  (-)  (-)  (-) \\nOther Financial Liabilities Note  16  376.87  -  -  - \\n (597.99) (-)  (-)  (-) \\nEmployee Benefit liabilities Note  16  128.78  -  -  - \\n (121.86)  (-)  (-)  (-) \\nUnclaimed dividends Note  16  2.29  -  -  - \\n (2.76)  (-)  (-)  (-) \\nLease Liabilities  91.09  182.98  189.87  282.34 \\n (75.49)  (155.79)  (151.01)  (201.82)\\n Figures in brackets are in respect of Previous year\\n\\n120\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST MARCH 2024\\nNOTE 26\\nA) Fair Values and Hierarchy\\n Set out below, is a comparison by class of the carrying amounts and fair value of the Company’s financial instruments, other than those with carrying \\namounts that are reasonable approximations of fair values:\\n(` Crores)\\nParticulars\\nHierarchy\\nCarrying Value / Fair Value\\nAs at  \\n31.03.2024\\nAs at  \\n31.03.2023\\nFinancial Assets\\n - Investments Level One  3381.90  3084.04 \\n - Derivative Financial Assets (Net) Level One  3.74  - \\n - Others financial assets Level One  25.75  24.02 \\nFinancial Liabilities\\n - Borrowings Level Two  -  - \\n - Derivative Financial Liabilities (Net) Level Two  -  1.09 \\n The management assessed that cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables, bank overdrafts and other current liabilities approximate \\ntheir carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.\\n The Fair Value of financial assets and liabilities included is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between \\nwilling parties.

Opinion\\n We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Financial \\nStatements of MRF Limited (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Holding \\nCompany”) and its subsidiaries (Holding Company and its \\nsubsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”) which comprise \\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2024, and \\nthe Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other \\nComprehensive Income),  the Consolidated Statement of Changes \\nin Equity and the Consolidated Cash Flows Statement for the year \\nended on that date and notes to financial statements, a summary \\nof material accounting policies and other explanatory information \\n(hereinafter referred to as “the Consolidated Financial Statements”).\\n In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to \\nthe explanations given to us, the aforesaid Consolidated Financial \\nStatements give the information required by the Companies Act, \\n2013 (“the Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and \\nfair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind \\nAS) prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with Companies \\n(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended and \\nother accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the \\nConsolidated state of affairs (financial position) of the Group as at \\n31st March, 2024, and its Consolidated profit (financial performance \\nincluding Other Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated Changes \\nin Equity and its Consolidated Cash Flows for the year ended on that \\ndate.\\n2. Basis for Opinion\\n We conducted our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements \\nin accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified \\nunder Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those \\nStandards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for \\nthe Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our \\nreport. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the \\nCode of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of \\nIndia (ICAI) together with the independence requirements that are \\nrelevant to our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements under \\nthe provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have \\nfulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these \\nrequirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the \\naudit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to \\nprovide a basis for our audit opinion on the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements.\\n3. Emphasis of Matter\\n We draw attention to Note 25 (j) (a) to the Consolidated Financial \\nStatement which describe the following matter:\\n In terms of the Order dated 31st August 2018 the Competition \\nCommission of India (CCI) has on 2nd February 2022 released its Order \\nimposing penalty on the Holding Company concerning the breach of \\nprovisions of the Competition Act, 2002 during the year 2011-2012 \\nand imposed a penalty of ` 622.09 Crores on the Holding Company.  \\nThe appeal filed by the Holding Company has been disposed of by \\nthe National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in December \\n2022, by remanding the matter to CCI for review after hearing the \\nparties.  CCI has in February 2023 filed an appeal against the Order \\nof NCLAT before the Hon’ble Supreme Court. Pending disposal, the \\nHolding Company has filed an appeal before the Hon’ble Supreme \\nCourt against the order of NCLAT, which has been tagged with the \\nappeal filed by CCI in the Supreme Court. The Holding Company is \\nof the view that no provision is considered necessary in respect of this \\nmatter in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\\n4. Key Audit Matters \\n Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, \\nwere of most significance in our audit of the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the \\ncontext of our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements as a \\nwhole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide \\na separate opinion on these matters.\\n\\n143\\nSr. \\nNo.\\nKey Audit Matter How the matter was addressed in our audit\\n1 Defined Benefit Obligation\\nThe valuation of the retirement benefit schemes in \\nthe Group is determined with reference to various \\nactuarial assumptions including discount rate, future \\nsalary increases, rate of inflation, mortality rates and \\nattrition rates. Due to the size of these schemes, \\nsmall changes in these assumptions can have a \\nmaterial impact on the estimated defined benefit \\nobligation.\\nOur audit procedures included: \\nWe have examined the key controls over the process involving member data, formulation of \\nassumptions and the financial reporting process in arriving at the provision for retirement benefits.  \\nWe tested the controls for determining the actuarial assumptions and the approval of those \\nassumptions by senior management. We found these key controls were designed, implemented \\nand operated effectively, and therefore determined that we could place reliance on these key \\ncontrols for the purposes of our audit.\\nWe tested the employee data used in calculating the obligation and  where material, we also \\nconsidered the treatment of curtailments, settlements, past service costs, remeasurements, \\nbenefits paid, and any other amendments made to obligations during the year. From the evidence \\nobtained, we found the data and assumptions used by management in the actuarial valuations for \\nretirement benefit obligations to be appropriate.\\n2 Provision for Sales related obligations\\nThe Holding Company makes an estimated provision \\nfor sales related obligations based on commitments, \\nestablished trade practices, historical trends and \\nother assumptions which are judgemental including \\nthose relating to outflow of resources.\\nConsidering the significant judgements involved in \\nmaking the above estimate, we have considered this \\nas a key audit matter. \\nOur audit procedures included: \\nWe understood and tested the controls over the assumptions applied in arriving at the provision \\nfor Sales related obligations.  \\nTested on sample basis, the provision made during the year with relevant data elements, \\nassumptions involved,  validation of formula used in the spread sheet and  management review \\nand control of the relevant internal and external factors impacting the provision.\\n3 Provision for Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) \\n(Refer Note 25 k) \\nThe Holding Company has recognised provision \\ntowards EPR obligations based on the notification \\nissued by the Ministry of Environment, Forest \\nand Climate Change.  The obligation is to be met \\nby purchasing certificates from Recyclers and \\nthe provision is estimated based on current cost \\nestimate.  \\nGiven the inherent complexity and the magnitude of \\nthe potential exposures and judgements necessary \\nto estimate the amount of provision required and to \\ndetermine required disclosures, we have considered \\nthis as a key audit matter.\\nOur audit procedures included: \\nWe have obtained an understanding on the requirement of the notification and of the process \\nfollowed by the Holding Company for assessment and determination of the amount of provision \\nrequired / recognized and the appropriateness of the disclosures made in the Consolidated \\nfinancial statements.\\n\\n144\\n4 Litigation, Claims and Contingent Liabilities\\n(Refer Note 25 (j), to be read along with Emphasis of \\nmatter in Independent Auditor’s Report.) \\n•\\t \\tThe\\tGroup\\tis\\texposed\\tto\\tvariety\\tof\\tdifferent\\t\\nlaws, regulations and interpretations thereof.  \\nConsequently, in the normal course of \\nbusiness, Provisions and Contingent Liabilities \\nmay arise from legal proceedings, constructive \\nobligations and commercial claims.\\n•\\t \\tManagement\\t applies\\t significant\\t judgement\\t\\nwhen considering whether and how much \\nto provide for the potential exposure of each \\nmatter.\\n•\\t \\tThese\\t estimates\\t could\\t change\\t substantially\\t\\nover time as new facts emerge as each legal \\ncase or matters progresses.\\n•\\t \\tGiven\\tthe\\tdifferent\\tviews\\tpossible,\\tbasis\\tthe\\t\\ninterpretations, complexity and the magnitude \\nof potential exposures and the judgement \\nnecessary to estimate the amount of provision \\nrequired or determine required disclosures.\\nOur audit procedures included: \\n•\\t \\tWe\\t understood\\t the\\t processes,\\t evaluated\\t the\\t design\\t and\\t implementation\\t of\\t controls\\t\\nand tested the operating effectiveness of the Group’s controls over the recording and  \\nre-assessment of uncertain legal positions, claims and contingent liabilities.\\n•\\t \\tWe\\theld\\tdiscussions\\twith\\tsenior\\tmanagement\\tincluding\\tthe\\tperson\\tresponsible\\tfor\\tlegal\\t\\nand compliance to obtain an understanding of the factors considered by management in \\nclassification of the matter as ‘probable’, ‘possible’ and ‘remote’.\\n•\\t \\tExamined\\tthe\\tHolding\\tCompany’s\\tlegal\\texpenses\\ton\\tsample\\tbasis\\tand\\tread\\tthe\\tminutes\\tof\\t\\nthe board meetings in order to ensure completeness.\\n•\\t \\tWith\\trespect\\tto\\ttax\\tmatters,\\tinvolving\\tour\\ttax\\tspecialists,\\tand\\tdiscussing\\twith\\tthe\\tHolding\\t\\nCompany’s tax officers, their views and strategies on significant cases, as well as the related \\ntechnical grounds relating to their conclusions based on applicable tax laws.\\n•\\t \\tAssessing\\tthe\\tdecisions\\tand\\trationale\\tfor\\tprovisions\\theld\\tor\\tfor\\tdecisions\\tnot\\tto\\trecord\\t\\nprovisions or make disclosures.\\n•\\t \\tFor\\tthose\\tmatters\\twhere\\tmanagement\\tconcluded\\tthat\\tno\\tprovisions\\tshould\\tbe\\trecorded,\\t\\nconsidering the adequacy and completeness of the disclosures. \\n5 Property, Plant & Equipment (Including Capex)\\n•\\t \\tTracking\\tand\\tmonitoring\\tcapex\\trequires\\tmore\\t\\nattention to ensure reasonable accurateness \\nand completeness of financial reporting in \\nrespect of Property, Plant and Equipment.\\n•\\t \\tFurther,\\t technical\\t complexities\\t require\\t\\nmanagement to assess and make estimates/\\njudgements about capitalization, estimated \\nuseful life, impairment etc. which has material \\nimpact on Balance sheet and operating results.\\n•\\t \\tRefer\\t note\\t 1\\t to\\t consolidated\\t financial\\t\\nstatements.\\nOur audit procedures included: \\nOur audit approach consisted testing of the design and operating effectiveness of the internal \\ncontrols and substantive testing as follows:\\n•\\t \\tWe\\tassessed\\tcompany’s\\tprocess\\tregarding\\tmaintenance\\tof\\trecords\\tand\\taccounting\\tof\\t\\ntransactions pertaining to Property, Plant and Equipment including capital work in progress \\nwith reference to Ind AS 16.\\n•\\t \\tWe\\thave\\tcarried\\tout\\tsubstantive\\taudit\\tprocedures\\tat\\tfinancial\\tand\\tassertion\\tlevel\\tto\\tverify\\t\\nthe capitalization of assets as Property, Plant & Equipment.\\n•\\t \\tWe\\thave\\treviewed\\tmanagement\\tjudgement\\tpertaining\\tto\\testimation\\tof\\tuseful\\tlife\\tand\\t\\ndepreciation of the Property, Plant and Equipment in accordance with Schedule II of the \\nCompanies Act, 2013.\\n•\\t \\tWe\\thave\\trelied\\ton\\tphysical\\tverification\\tconducted\\tby\\tmanagement\\tand\\tmanagement\\t\\nrepresentations.\\n\\n145\\n5. Information Other than the Consolidated Financial Statements and \\nAuditor’s Report thereon\\n The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors are \\nresponsible for the preparation of the other information.  The other \\ninformation comprises the information included in the Holding \\nCompany’s Board’s Report including Annexures to Board’s Report, \\nManagement Discussion and Analysis, Report on Corporate \\nGovernance, Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report, but \\ndoes not include the Consolidated Financial Statements and our \\nauditor’s report thereon.\\n Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements does not \\ncover the other information and we do not express any form of \\nassurance conclusion thereon.\\n In connection with our audit of the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, \\nin doing so, consider whether the other information is materially \\ninconsistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements or our \\nknowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise \\nappears to be materially misstated.\\n If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is \\na material misstatement of this other information, we are required to \\nreport that fact.  We have nothing to report in this regard.\\n6. Management’s Responsibility and Those Charged with Governance \\nfor the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the \\npreparation and presentation of these Consolidated Financial \\nStatements in term of the requirements of the  Act  that give a true \\nand fair view of the Consolidated financial position, Consolidated \\nfinancial performance including other comprehensive income, \\nConsolidated Changes in Equity and Consolidated Cash Flows of \\nthe Group in accordance with the accounting principles generally \\naccepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind \\nAS) specified under section 133 of the Act. The respective Board of \\nDirectors of the companies included in the Group are responsible \\nfor maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with \\nthe provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and \\nfor preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection \\nand application of appropriate accounting policies; making \\njudgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and \\nthe design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal \\nfinancial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring \\naccuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant \\nto the preparation and presentation of the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements that give a true and fair view and are free from material \\nmisstatement, whether due to fraud or error. \\n In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the respective \\nBoard of Directors of the companies included in the Group are \\nresponsible for assessing the ability of the Group to continue as a \\ngoing concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going \\nconcern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless \\nmanagement either intends to liquidate the Companies or to cease \\noperations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\\n The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the \\nGroup are responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process \\nof the Companies.\\n7. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the audit of the Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements\\n Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether \\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole are free from \\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue \\nan auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance \\nis a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit \\nconducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material \\nmisstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or \\nerror and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, \\nthey could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \\ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these Consolidated Financial \\nStatements.\\n As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional \\njudgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the \\naudit.  We also:\\n\\n146\\n\\t •\\t Identify\\t and\\tassess\\tthe\\trisks\\tof\\tmaterial\\tmisstatement\\tof\\tthe\\t\\nConsolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or \\nerror, design and perform audit procedures responsive to \\nthose risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and \\nappropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITy FOR INTERNAL FINANCIAL \\nCONTROLS\\n The Respective Board of Directors of the Holding Company and \\nits subsidiary companies incorporated in India, are responsible \\nfor establishing and maintaining internal financial controls with \\nreference to Consolidated Financial Statements based on the \\ninternal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial \\nStatements criteria established by the respective Companies \\nconsidering the essential components of internal control stated in \\nthe Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over \\nFinancial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants \\nof India (ICAI). These responsibilities include the design, \\nimplementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial \\ncontrols that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and \\nefficient conduct of its business, including adherence to respective \\ncompany’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention \\nand detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness \\nof the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable \\nfinancial information, as required under the Act.\\n2. AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITy \\n Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial \\ncontrols with reference to Financial Statements of the Holding \\nCompany and its subsidiary companies which are incorporated in \\nIndia, based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance \\nwith the Guidance Note issued by ICAI and the Standards on \\nAuditing, issued by ICAI and prescribed under section 143(10) of \\nthe Act,to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial \\ncontrols, both issued by ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance \\nNote require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan \\nand perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether \\nadequate internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements were established and maintained and if such \\ncontrols operated effectively in all material respects. \\n Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit \\nevidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls \\nwith reference to Consolidated Financial Statements and their \\noperating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with \\nreference to Consolidated Financial Statements includes obtaining \\nan understanding of internal financial controls with reference \\nto Consolidated Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a \\nmaterial weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and \\noperating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed \\nrisk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, \\nincluding the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the \\nconsolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. \\n We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the \\naudit evidence obtained by other auditors of a subsidiary company \\nincorporated in India, in terms of their report referred to in other \\nmatters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide\\n\\n151\\na basis for our audit opinion on the Company and its subsidiary \\ncompanies which are incorporated in India.  \\n3. MEANING OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS WITH \\nREFERENCE TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n A company’s internal financial control with reference to \\nConsolidated Financial Statements is a process designed to provide \\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting \\nand the preparation of financial statements for external purposes \\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A \\ncompany’s internal financial control with reference to Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements includes those policies and procedures \\nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable \\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions \\nof the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance \\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation \\nof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted \\naccounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the \\ncompany are being made only in accordance with authorisations \\nof management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide \\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of \\nunauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s \\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\n4. INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS \\nWITH REFERENCE TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial control \\nwith reference to Consolidated Financial Statements including \\nthe possibility of collusion or improper management override of \\ncontrols, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur \\nand not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the \\ninternal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial \\nStatements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal \\nfinancial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements \\nmay become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that \\nthe degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may \\ndeteriorate.\\n5. OTHER MATTERS\\n Our aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the \\nadequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial \\ncontrols with reference to Financial Statements in so far as it relates \\nto subsidiary companies,  incorporated in India, is based on the \\nreport of the auditors.\\nFor M.M.

Control is achieved when the Holding Company is \\nexposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement \\nwith the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through \\nits power over the investee. Specifically, the Holding Company \\ncontrols an investee if and only if the Holding Company has:\\n\\t •\\t Power\\t over\\tthe\\tinvestee\\t(i.e.\\texisting\\trights\\tthat\\tgive\\tit\\tthe\\t\\ncurrent ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee),\\n\\t •\\t Exposure,\\t or\\trights,\\tto\\tvariable\\treturns\\tfrom\\tits\\tinvolvement\\t\\nwith the investee, and\\n\\t •\\t The\\t ability\\tto\\tuse\\tits\\tpower\\tover\\tthe\\tinvestee\\tto\\taffect\\tits\\t\\nreturns.\\n Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights \\nresult in control. To support this presumption and when the Holding \\nCompany has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of \\nan investee, the Holding Company considers all relevant facts and \\ncircumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, \\nincluding:\\n\\t •\\t The\\t contractual\\tarrangement\\twith\\tthe\\tother\\tvote\\tholders\\tof\\tthe\\t\\ninvestee.\\n\\t •\\t Rights\\tarising\\tfrom\\tother\\tcontractual\\tarrangements.\\n\\t •\\t The\\t Holding\\tCompany’s\\tvoting\\trights\\tand\\tpotential\\tvoting\\t\\nrights.\\n\\t •\\t The\\t size\\tof\\tthe\\tHolding\\tCompany’s\\tholding\\tof\\tvoting\\trights\\t\\nrelative to the size and dispersion of the holdings of the other \\nvoting rights holders.\\n The Holding Company re-assesses whether or not it controls an \\ninvestee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes \\nto one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of \\na Subsidiary begins when the Holding Company obtains control \\nover the Subsidiary and ceases when the Holding Company loses \\ncontrol of the Subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of \\na Subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included \\nin the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date the Holding \\nCompany gains control until the date the Holding Company ceases \\nto control the Subsidiary.\\n Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared using uniform \\naccounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar \\ncircumstances. If a member of the group uses accounting policies\\n\\n163\\nother than those adopted in the Consolidated Financial Statements \\nfor like transactions and events in similar circumstances, appropriate \\nadjustments, if material, are made to that group’s Financial \\nStatements in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements to \\nensure conformity with the group’s accounting policies.\\n The Financial Statements of all entities used for the purpose of \\nconsolidation are drawn up to same reporting date as that of the \\nparent Holding Company, i.e., year ended on 31 March.\\n Consolidation procedure:\\n a) Combine like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income, \\nexpenses and cash flows of the Holding Company with those \\nof its Subsidiaries. \\n b) Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of the Holding \\nCompany’s investment in each Subsidiary and the Holding \\nCompany’s portion of equity of each Subsidiary.\\n c) Eliminate in full intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, \\nincome, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions \\nbetween entities of the group (profits or losses resulting from \\nintragroup transactions that are recognised in assets, such as \\ninventory and Property, Plant and Equipment, are eliminated \\nin full). Intragroup losses may indicate an impairment that \\nrequires recognition in the Consolidated Financial Statements. \\nInd AS 12 Income Taxes applies to temporary differences that \\narise from the elimination of profits and losses resulting from \\nintragroup transactions.\\n Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income \\n(OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the Holding Company \\nof the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this \\nresults in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. \\nWhen necessary, adjustments are made to the Financial Statements \\nof Subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies in line with the \\nHolding Company’s accounting policies. \\n A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss \\nof control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the Holding \\nCompany loses control over a Subsidiary, it:\\n\\t •\\t Derecognises\\t the\\tassets\\t(including\\tgoodwill)\\tand\\tliabilities\\tof\\t\\nthe Subsidiary\\n\\t •\\t Derecognises\\t the\\t carrying\\t amount\\t of\\t any\\t non-controlling\\t\\ninterests\\n\\t •\\t Derecognises\\t the\\tcumulative\\ttranslation\\tdifferences\\trecorded\\t\\nin equity\\n\\t •\\t Recognises\\tthe\\tfair\\tvalue\\tof\\tthe\\tconsideration\\treceived\\n\\t •\\t Recognises\\tthe\\tfair\\tvalue\\tof\\tany\\tinvestment\\tretained\\n\\t •\\t Recognises\\tany\\tsurplus\\tor \\tdeficit\\tin\\tprofit\\tor\\tloss\\n\\t •\\t Reclassifies\\t the\\t Holding\\t Company’s\\t share\\t of\\t components\\t\\npreviously recognised in OCI to profit or loss or retained \\nearnings, as appropriate, as would be required if the Holding \\nCompany had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities\\nC) Basis of preparation of Financial Statements\\n The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these \\nConsolidated Financial Statements are set out below. These policies \\nhave been consistently applied to all the years presented.\\n i. Statement of Compliance\\n  The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in \\naccordance with IND AS as prescribed under Section 133 of \\nthe Companies Act, 2013 read with Rule 3 of the Companies \\n(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and subsequent \\namendments thereto.\\n ii. Basis of preparation and presentation\\n  The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared \\non historical cost basis considering the applicable provisions \\nof Companies Act 2013, except for the following items that \\nhave been measured at fair value as required by relevant IND \\nAS. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the \\nconsideration given in exchange for goods and services.\\n\\n164\\n  a) Certain financial assets/liabilities measured at fair value \\n((Refer Note 1 (D 10)) and\\n  b) Any other item as specifically stated in the accounting \\npolicy.\\n  The Consolidated Financial Statement are presented in INR \\nand all values are rounded off to Rupees Crores  unless \\notherwise stated.\\n  The group reclassifies comparative amounts, unless \\nimpracticable and whenever the group changes the \\npresentation or classification of items in its Financial \\nStatements materially. No such material reclassification has \\nbeen made during the year.\\n  The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group for the \\nyear ended 31st March, 2024 were authorised for issue in \\naccordance with a resolution of the directors on 3rd May, \\n2024.\\n iii. Major Sources of Estimation Uncertainty \\n  In the application of accounting policy which are described in \\npara (D) below, the management is required to make judgment, \\nestimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets \\nand liabilities, income and expenses, contingent liabilities and \\nthe accompanying disclosures that are not readily apparent \\nfrom other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions \\nare based on historical experience and other factors that are \\nconsidered to be relevant and are prudent and reasonable.  \\nActual results may differ from those estimates. The estimates \\nand underlying assumptions are reviewed on ongoing basis. \\nRevisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period \\nin which the estimates are revised if the revision affects only \\nthat period or in the period of revision and future periods if the \\nrevision affects both current and future period.\\n  The few critical estimations and judgments made in applying \\naccounting policies are:\\n  Property, Plant and Equipment/Intangible Assets:\\n  Useful life of Property, Plant and Equipment are as specified \\nin Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 and on certain \\nintangible assets based on technical advice which considered \\nthe nature of the asset, the usage of the asset, expected \\nphysical wear and tear, the operating conditions of the asset, \\nanticipated technological changes, manufacturers warranties \\nand maintenance support. The Group reviews the useful life \\nof Property, Plant and Equipment at the end of each reporting \\nperiod. This reassessment may result in change in depreciation \\ncharge in future periods. (Refer Note 1 (D 1))\\n  Impairment of Non-financial Assets:\\n  For calculating the recoverable amount of non-financial assets, \\nthe Group is required to estimate the value-in-use of the asset \\nor the Cash Generating Unit and the fair value less costs to \\ndisposal. For calculating value in use the Group is required \\nto estimate the cash flows to be generated from using the \\nasset. The fair value of an asset is estimated using a valuation \\ntechnique where observable prices are not available. Further, \\nthe discount rate used in value in use calculations includes an \\nestimate of risk assessment specific to the asset. \\n  Impairment of Financial Assets:\\n  The Group impairs financial assets other than those measured \\nat fair value through profit or loss or designated at fair value \\nthrough other comprehensive income on expected credit \\nlosses. The estimation of expected credit loss includes the \\nestimation of probability of default (PD), loss given default \\n(LGD) and the exposure at default (EAD). Estimation of \\nprobability of default apart from involving trend analysis of \\npast delinquency rates include an estimation on forward-\\nlooking information relating to not only the counterparty but \\nalso relating to the industry and the economy as a whole. \\nThe probability of default is estimated for the entire life of \\nthe contract by estimating the cash flows that are likely to \\nbe received in default scenario. The lifetime PD is reduced \\nto 12 months PD based on an assessment of past history of\\n\\n165\\ndefault cases in 12 months. Further, the loss given default is \\ncalculated based on an estimate of the value of the security \\nrecoverable as on the reporting date. The exposure at default \\nis the amount outstanding at the balance sheet date. (Refer \\nNote 1 (D 10))\\n  Defined Benefit Plans:\\n  The cost of the defined benefit plan and other post-\\nemployment benefits and the present value of such obligations \\nare determined using actuarial valuations.  An actuarial \\nvaluation involves making various assumptions that may differ \\nfrom actual developments in the future.  These include the \\ndetermination of the discount rate, future salary increases, \\nmortality rates and attrition rate.  Due to the complexities \\ninvolved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined \\nbenefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these \\nassumptions.  All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting \\ndate.\\n  Fair Value Measurement of Financial Instruments:\\n  When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities \\nrecorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on \\nquoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured \\nusing valuation techniques including the Discounted Cash \\nFlow (DCF) model.  The inputs to these models are taken \\nfrom observable markets where possible, but where this is \\nnot feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing \\nfair values. Judgments include considerations of inputs \\nsuch as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility.  Changes in \\nassumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair \\nvalue of financial instruments. (Refer Note 1 (D 10))\\n  Income Taxes\\n  Significant judgments are involved in determining the \\nprovision for income taxes, including amount expected to be \\npaid/recovered for uncertain tax positions. (Refer Note 1 (D 9))\\n  In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, \\nmanagement considers whether some portion or all of the \\ndeferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate \\nrealization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon \\nthe generation of future taxable income during the periods \\nin which the temporary differences become deductible. \\nManagement considers the scheduled reversals of deferred \\nincome tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax \\nplanning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the \\nlevel of historical taxable income and projections for future \\ntaxable income over the periods in which the deferred income \\ntax assets are deductible, management believes that the \\ngroup will realize the benefits of those deductible differences. \\nThe amount of the deferred income tax assets considered \\nrealizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if \\nestimates of future taxable income during the carry forward \\nperiod are reduced.\\n  Leases\\n  Ind AS 116 requires lessees to determine the lease term as the \\nnon-cancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option \\nto extend or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is \\nreasonably certain. The Group makes an assessment on the \\nexpected lease term on a lease-by-lease basis and thereby \\nassesses whether it is reasonably certain that any options \\nto extend or terminate the contract will be exercised. In \\nevaluating the lease term, the Group considers factors such as \\nany significant leasehold improvements undertaken over the \\nlease term, costs relating to the termination of the lease and \\nthe importance of the underlying asset to Group’s operations \\ntaking into account the location of the underlying asset and \\nthe availability of suitable alternatives. The lease term in future \\nperiods is reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the \\ncurrent economic circumstances.  After considering current \\nand future economic conditions, the Group concludes that no \\nchanges are required to lease period relating to the existing \\nlease contracts. (Refer Note 1 (D 4)).\\n\\n166\\n  Allowance for credit losses on receivables:\\n  The Group determines the allowance for credit losses based \\non historical loss experience adjusted to reflect current and \\nestimated future economic conditions. The Group considered \\ncurrent and anticipated future economic conditions relating \\nto industries the Group deals with and the countries where \\nit operates. In calculating expected credit loss, the Group \\nhas also considered credit reports and other related credit \\ninformation for its customers to estimate the probability of \\ndefault in future. \\n D) Summary of Material Accounting Policies:\\n  Ind AS 1 was amended vide notification no G.S.R.242(E) dated \\n31st March 2023 to require disclosure of Material Accounting \\nPolicy information from accounting periods beginning on or \\nafter 1 April 2023 instead of significant accounting policy \\ndisclosure by amending paragraph 117, inserting paragraphs \\n117A to 117E and deleting paragraphs 118 to 121. Paragraph \\n117 of Ind AS 1 states when an information on accounting \\npolicy is considered as ‘Material Accounting Policy \\ninformation’ as follows:\\n  Accounting policy information is material if, when considered \\ntogether with other information included in an entity’s \\nfinancial statements, it can reasonably be expected to influence \\ndecisions that the primary users of general-purpose financial \\nstatements make on the basis of those financial statements.\\n  Each of the policy disclosed herein below has been tested \\nto determine whether the information disclosed is Material \\nAccounting Policy information.\\n  1) Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE):\\n   The Group has elected to continue with the carrying value \\nof Property, Plant and Equipment (‘PPE’) recognised as of \\nthe transition date, measured as per the Previous GAAP \\nand use that carrying value as its deemed cost.\\n   Property, Plant and Equipment are stated at cost less \\naccumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment \\nlosses except for freehold land which is not amortised. \\nAny gain or loss arising on derecognition of an item \\nof property, plant and equipment is determined as the \\ndifference between the net disposal proceeds and the \\ncarrying amount of the asset and is recognized in profit \\nor loss with other income or other expense line item on \\nnet basis, respectively.\\n   The depreciable amount of an asset is determined \\nafter deducting its residual value.  Depreciation on the \\nproperty, plant and equipment, is provided over the \\nuseful life of assets based on management estimates \\nwhich is in line with the useful life indicated in Schedule \\nII to the Companies Act, 2013. Depreciation on all assets \\nexcept Renewable Energy Saving Devices is provided on \\nstraight line basis whereas depreciation on renewable \\nenergy saving devices is provided on reducing balance \\nbasis. Given below are the estimated useful lives for \\neach class of property, plant and equipment: \\nDescription of the Asset Estimated Useful \\nlife(On Single \\nshift working)\\nTangible (Owned Assets) :\\nBuilding - Factory\\n      - Other than factory buildings\\n30 Years\\n60 Years  \\nPlant and Equipment 5-21 Years\\nMoulds 6 Years\\nFurniture and Fixtures  5 Years\\nComputer Servers 5 Years\\nComputers 3 Years\\nOffice Equipment 5 Years\\nOther Assets, viz., Electrical Fittings, Fire Fighting/\\nOther Equipments and Canteen Utensils\\n8-10 Years\\nRenewable Energy Saving Device – Windmills 22 Years\\n\\n167\\nDescription of the Asset Estimated Useful \\nlife(On Single \\nshift working)\\nVehicles 5 Years\\nAircraft 10 and 20 Years\\nRight of Use Assets (Leased Assets) :\\n- Buildings-Other than factory buildings 1-21 Years\\n- Vehicles 2 Years\\n- Land – Leasehold Primary period of \\nlease\\nIntangible(Owned Assets):  \\nSoftware 5 Years\\n   In respect of Property, Plant and Equipment of MRF \\nLanka Pvt. Ltd. and MRF SG PTE. LTD. depreciation is \\nprovided on straight line method based on management \\nestimate of useful life of assets based on internal \\ntechnical evaluation, except for certain Property, Plant \\nand Equipment namely Building, Plant and Machinery, \\nMoulds and Equipments of MRF Lanka Pvt Ltd, which \\nare depreciated on Written Down Value method. The \\nproportion of depreciation of the Subsidiaries to the total \\ndepreciation of the group is not material.\\n  2) Intangible Assets:\\n   Intangible assets acquired separately are measured \\non initial recognition at cost. After initial recognition, \\nintangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated \\namortisation and accumulated impairment losses. \\n   Software (not being an integral part of the related \\nhardware) acquired for internal use are treated as \\nintangible assets. \\n   Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of an intangible \\nasset is determined as the difference between the net \\ndisposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset \\nand is recognized in profit or loss with other income or \\nother expense line item on net basis, respectively. \\n   Intangible Assets are amortised over 5 years on straight-\\nline method over the estimated useful economic life of \\nthe assets.\\n   The Group undertakes Research and Development \\nactivities for development of new and improved \\nproducts. The Group recognises all expenditure incurred \\nduring the research phase in the profit or loss whereas \\nthe expenditure incurred in development phase are \\npresented as Intangible Assets under Development \\ntill the time they are available for use in the manner \\nintended at which moment they are treated as Intangible \\nAssets and amortised over their estimated useful life.\\n  3) Inventories:\\n   Inventories consisting of stores and spares, raw \\nmaterials, work in progress, stock in trade and finished \\ngoods are measured at lower of cost and net realisable \\nvalue. However, materials held for use in production \\nof inventories are not written down below cost, if the \\nfinished products are expected to be sold at or above \\ncost.\\n   The cost is computed on FIFO basis except for stores and \\nspares which are on daily moving Weighted Average \\nCost basis. \\n   Inventory obsolescence is based on assessment of \\nthe future uses. Obsolete and slow-moving items are \\nsubjected to continuous technical monitoring.\\n  4) Leases:\\n   The Group as a lessee\\n   The Group’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases \\nfor land, buildings and vehicles. The Group assesses \\nwhether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a \\ncontract.\\n\\n168\\n   At the date of commencement of the lease, the \\nGroup recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a \\ncorresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements \\nin which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of \\ntwelve months or less (short-term leases) and low value \\nleases. For these short-term and low value leases, the \\nGroup recognizes the lease payments as an operating \\nexpense on a straight-line basis over the term of the \\nlease.\\n   Lease term includes extension or termination options \\nwhen it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.\\n   The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost \\nand subsequently measured at cost less accumulated \\ndepreciation and impairment losses.\\n   Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the \\ncommencement date on a straight-line basis over the \\nshorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying \\nasset. \\n   The lease liability is initially measured at the present \\nvalue of the future lease payments. The lease payments \\nare discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease \\nor, if not readily determinable, using the incremental \\nborrowing rates. Lease liabilities are remeasured with \\na corresponding adjustment to the related right of use \\nasset if the Group changes its assessment of whether it \\nwill exercise an extension or a termination option.\\n  5) Government Grants:\\n   The grant relating to export benefits is presented under \\nother income on a systematic basis in the Profit or Loss \\nover the periods necessary to match them with the \\nrelated costs, which they are intended to compensate. \\nSubsidies received from State Government are presented \\nunder other operating income. Where the grant relates \\nto an asset under EPCG Scheme, it is presented as a \\ndeferred income aggregated under other liabilities in \\nBalance Sheet and presented under other income in \\nequal amounts over the expected useful life of the related \\nasset. Where the assets have been fully depreciated with \\nno future related cost, the grant is recognised in profit or \\nloss.\\n   When loans or similar assistance are provided by \\ngovernments or related institutions, with an interest rate \\nbelow the current applicable market rate, the effect of \\nthis favourable interest is regarded as a government \\ngrant.  The loan or assistance is initially recognised \\nand measured at fair value and the government grant is \\nmeasured as the difference between the initial carrying \\nvalue of the loan and the proceeds received.  The loan \\nis subsequently measured as per the accounting policy \\napplicable to financial liabilities in respect of loans/\\nassistance received subsequent to the date of transition.\\n  6) Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent \\nAssets:\\n   Provisions are recognized when there is a present legal \\nor constructive obligation as a result of a past event and \\nit is probable (i.e. more likely than not) that an outflow \\nof resources embodying economic benefits will be \\nrequired to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate \\ncan be made of the amount of the obligation.  \\n   Provision for separate sales related obligations is made \\nfor probable future claims on sales effected and are \\nestimated based on previous claim experience on a \\nscientific basis.  This provision is revised annually.\\n   Contingent liabilities are disclosed on the basis of \\njudgment of management / independent experts.  These \\nare reviewed at each balance sheet date and are adjusted \\nto reflect the current management estimate.\\n\\n169\\n  7) Revenue Recognition:\\n   The Group derives revenues primarily from sale of goods \\ncomprising of Automobile Tyres, Tubes, Flaps, Tread \\nRubber and Speciality Coatings. \\n   Revenue from contract with customers is recognised \\nupon transfer of control of promised products or services \\nto customers in an amount that reflects the consideration \\nthe Group expects to receive in exchange for those \\nproducts or services.\\n   Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised at the point \\nin time when control is transferred to the customer.\\n   Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance obligation \\nis measured at the amount of transaction price allocated \\nto that performance obligation. The transaction price \\nof goods sold and services rendered is net of variable \\nconsideration on account of turnover/product/prompt \\npayment discounts and schemes offered by the Group as \\npart of the contract with the customers.  When the level \\nof discount varies with increase in levels of revenue \\ntransactions, the Group recognises the liability based \\non its estimate of the customer’s future purchases using \\nexpected value method. The Group recognises changes \\nin the estimated amounts of obligations for discounts \\nin the period in which the change occurs. The Holding \\nCompany considers certain other commitments in the \\ncontract that are separate sales related performance \\nobligations and claims preferred during the year \\nagainst such contractual obligations are netted off from \\nRevenue, consistent with its current practice. Revenue \\nalso excludes taxes collected from customers.\\n   Revenue in excess of invoicing is classified as contract \\nassets while invoicing in excess of revenues are classified \\nas contract liabilities.\\n   Use of significant judgements in Revenue Recognition:\\n\\t \\t \\t •\\t Judgement\\t is\\trequired\\tto\\tdetermine\\tthe\\ttransaction\\t\\nprice for the contract.  The transaction price \\ncould be either a fixed amount of consideration \\nor variable consideration with elements such as \\nturnover/product/prompt payment discounts. Any \\nconsideration payable to the customer is adjusted \\nto the transaction price, unless it is a payment for \\na distinct product or service from the customer. \\nThe estimated amount of variable consideration is \\nadjusted in the transaction price only to the extent \\nthat it is highly probable that a significant reversal \\nin the amount of cumulative revenue recognised \\nwill not occur and is reassessed at the end of each \\nreporting period.\\n\\t \\t \\t •\\t The\\t Group\\t exercises\\t judgement\\t in\\t determining\\t\\nwhether the performance obligation is satisfied \\nat a point in time or over a period of time. The \\nGroup considers indicators such as how customer \\nconsumes benefits as services are rendered or who \\ncontrols the asset as it is being created or existence \\nof enforceable right to payment for performance to \\ndate and alternate use of such product or service, \\ntransfer of significant risks and rewards to the \\ncustomer, acceptance of delivery by the customer.  \\n  8) Employee Benefits:\\n   a) Short term Employee Benefits:\\n    All employee benefits payable wholly within \\ntwelve months of rendering services are classified \\nas short-term employee benefits. Benefits such as \\nsalaries, wages, short-term compensated absences \\nand performance incentives, are recognised during \\nthe period in which the employee renders related \\nservices and are measured at undiscounted amount \\nexpected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.\\n\\n170\\n   b) Long Term Employee Benefits:\\n    The cost of providing long term employee benefit \\nsuch as earned leave is measured as the present \\nvalue of expected future payments to be made in \\nrespect of services provided by employees upto \\nthe end of the reporting period.  The expected \\ncosts of the benefit is accrued over the period \\nof employment using the same methodology \\nas used for defined benefits post-employment \\nplans. Actuarial gains and losses arising from the \\nexperience adjustments and changes in actuarial \\nassumptions are charged or credited to profit or \\nloss section of the Statement of Profit or Loss in the \\nperiod in which they arise except those included in \\ncost of assets as permitted. The benefit is measured \\nannually by independent actuary.\\n   c) Post Employment Benefits:\\n    The Group provides the following post \\nemployment benefits:\\n    i)  Defined benefit plans such as gratuity, \\ntrust managed Provident Fund and post-\\nretirement medical benefit (PRMB); and\\n    ii)  Defined contribution plans such as provident \\nfund, pension fund and superannuation \\nfund.\\n   d) Defined benefits Plans:\\n    The cost of providing benefits on account of \\ngratuity and post retirement medical benefits / \\nobligations are determined using the projected unit \\ncredit method on the basis of actuarial valuation \\nmade at the end of each balance sheet date.\\n    Re-measurements comprising of actuarial gains \\nand losses arising from experience adjustments and \\nchange in actuarial assumptions, the effect of change \\nin assets ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan \\nasset (excluding net interest) are recognised in other \\ncomprehensive income (OCI) except those included \\nin cost of assets as permitted in the period in which \\nthey occur.  Re-measurements are not reclassified to \\nthe Statement of Profit and Loss in subsequent periods.\\n    Eligible employees of the Group receive benefits \\nfrom a provident fund trust which is a defined \\nbenefit plan. Both the eligible employee and the \\nGroup make monthly contributions to the provident \\nfund plan equal to a specified percentage of the \\ncovered employees salary. The Group contributes a \\npart of the contribution to the provident fund trusts. \\nTrusts invests in specific designated instruments as \\npermitted by Indian Law. The remaining portion \\nis contributed to the Government Administered \\nPension Fund. The rate at which the annual \\ninterest is payable to the beneficiaries by the trusts \\nis administered by the Government. The Group \\nhas obligation to make good the shortfall, if any, \\nbetween the return from investments of the Trusts \\nand the notified interest rate. However, as at the \\nyear-end no shortfall remains unprovided for. \\n   e) Defined Contribution Plans:\\n    Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit \\nplans, viz., Provident Fund for certain eligible \\nemployees, Pension Fund and Superannuation \\nbenefits are recognised as an expense when \\nemployees have rendered the service entitling \\nthem to the contribution.\\n  9) Taxes on Income:\\n   Income tax expense represents the sum of tax currently \\npayable and deferred tax.  Tax is recognised in the profit \\nor loss section of the Statement of Profit and Loss, except \\nto the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in \\nequity or in other comprehensive income.\\n\\n171\\n   a) Current Tax:\\n    Current tax is the expected tax payable/ receivable on \\nthe taxable income/ loss for the year using applicable \\ntax rates under the relevant tax laws for the relevant \\nperiod, and any adjustment to taxes in respect of \\nprevious years. Interest expenses and penalties, if any, \\nrelated to income tax are included in finance cost and \\nother expenses respectively. Interest Income, if any, \\nrelated to Income tax is included in Other Income.\\n   b) Deferred Tax:\\n    Deferred tax is recognised on temporary \\ndifferences between the carrying amounts of \\nassets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the \\ncorresponding tax bases used in the computation \\nof taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are \\nrecognised for all taxable temporary differences. \\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for all \\ndeductible temporary differences, unabsorbed \\nlosses and unabsorbed depreciation  to the extent \\nthat it is probable that future taxable profits will \\nbe available against which those deductible \\ntemporary differences, unabsorbed losses and \\nunabsorbed depreciation can be utilised. \\n    The deferred tax assets (net) and deferred tax \\nliabilities (net) are determined separately for the \\nparent and for each subsidiary in the Group, as per \\ntheir applicable Laws and then aggregated.  \\n  10) Financial Instruments:\\n   Financial Assets\\n   A financial asset inter-alia includes any asset that is cash, \\nequity instrument of another entity or contractual rights \\nto receive cash or another financial asset or to exchange \\nfinancial asset or financial liability under condition that \\nare potentially favourable to the Company.\\n   Financial assets other than investment in subsidiaries \\n   Financial assets of the Group comprise trade receivable, \\ncash and cash equivalents, Bank balances, Investments \\nin equity shares of companies other than in subsidiaries, \\nInvestment in units of Mutual Funds, loans/Debt \\ninstrument/advances to employee / related parties / \\nothers, security deposit, claims recoverable etc. \\n   Initial recognition and measurement\\n   All financial assets are recognised initially at fair \\nvalue plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded \\nat fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs \\nthat are attributable to the acquisition of the financial \\nasset. However, Trade receivables that do not contain \\na significant financing component are measured at \\nTransaction Price. Transaction costs of financial assets \\ncarried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed \\nin profit or loss. \\n   Subsequent measurement\\n   For purposes of subsequent measurement financial \\nassets are classified in three categories: \\n\\t \\t \\t •\\t Financial\\tassets\\tmeasured\\tat\\tamortized\\tcost\\t\\n\\t \\t \\t •\\t Financial\\t assets\\tat\\tfair\\tvalue\\tthrough\\tOCI\\t–\\tDebt\\t\\nInstruments \\n\\t \\t \\t •\\t Financial\\tassets\\tat\\tfair\\tvalue\\tthrough\\tprofit\\tor\\tloss\\t\\n   Financial assets measured at amortized cost\\n   Bank deposits and Export benefits receivable are \\nmeasured at amortised cost.  Financial assets are \\nmeasured at amortized cost if the financials asset is \\nheld within a business model whose objective is to hold \\nfinancial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows \\nand the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise \\non specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments\\n\\n172\\nof principal and interest on the principal amount \\noutstanding. These financials assets are amortized using \\nthe effective interest rate (EIR) method, less impairment. \\nAmortized cost is calculated by taking into account any \\ndiscount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs \\nthat are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization \\nis included in finance income in the statement of profit \\nand loss. \\n   Financial assets at fair value through OCI (FVTOCI)\\n   Investment in Debt instruments are measured at  FVTOCI.  \\nFinancial assets are mandatorily measured at fair value \\nthrough other comprehensive income if the financial \\nasset is held within a business model whose objective is \\nachieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and \\nselling financial assets and the contractual terms of the \\nfinancial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows \\nthat are solely payments of principal and interest on the \\nprincipal amount outstanding. \\n   At initial recognition, an irrevocable election is made \\n(on an instrument-by-instrument basis) to designate \\ninvestments in equity instruments other than held \\nfor trading purpose at FVTOCI. Fair value changes \\nrelating to financial assets measured at FVTOCI are \\nrecognised in the other comprehensive income (OCI). \\nOn derecognition of the financial asset other than \\nequity instruments, cumulative gain or loss previously \\nrecognised in OCI is reclassified to Profit or Loss.\\n   Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss \\n(FVTPL)\\n   Any financial asset that does not meet the criteria for \\nclassification as at amortized cost or as financial assets \\nat fair value through other comprehensive income, is \\nclassified as financial assets at fair value through profit \\nor loss.\\n   Derecognition\\n   The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the \\ncontractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, \\nor when it transfers the financial asset and substantially \\nall the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to \\nanother entity. \\n   Impairment of financial assets\\n   The Group assesses impairment based on expected \\ncredit loss (ECL) model on the following:\\n\\t \\t \\t •\\t Financial\\t assets\\tthat\\tare\\tmeasured\\tat\\tamortised\\t\\ncost. \\n\\t \\t \\t •\\t Financial\\t assets\\t (excluding\\t equity\\t instruments)\\t\\nmeasured at fair value through other \\ncomprehensive income (FVTOCI).\\n   ECL is measured through a loss allowance on a following \\nbasis after considering the value of recoverable security:-  \\n\\t \\t \\t •\\t The\\t 12\\tmonth\\texpected\\tcredit\\tlosses\\t(expected\\t\\ncredit losses that result from those default events \\non the financial instruments that are possible \\nwithin 12 months after the reporting date). \\n\\t \\t \\t •\\t Full\\t life\\t time\\t expected\\t credit\\t losses\\t (expected\\t\\ncredit losses that result from all possible default \\nevents over the life of financial instruments).\\n   The Group follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition \\nof impairment on trade receivables or contract assets \\nresulting from normal business transactions. The \\napplication of simplified approach does not require \\nthe Group to track changes in credit risk. However, it \\nrecognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime \\nECLs at each reporting date,   from the date of initial \\nrecognition.\\n   For recognition of impairment loss on other financial \\nassets, the Group determines whether there has been\\n\\n173\\na significant increase in the credit risk since initial \\nrecognition. If credit risk has increased significantly, \\nlifetime ECL is provided. For assessing increase in credit \\nrisk and impairment loss, the Group assesses the credit \\nrisk characteristics on instrument-by-instrument basis.\\n   Impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognised \\nduring the period is recognised as expense/income in \\nprofit and loss.\\n   Financial Liabilities\\n   The Group’s financial liabilities include borrowings, \\ntrade payable, lease liabilities, accrued expenses and \\nother payables.\\n   Initial recognition and measurement\\n   All financial liabilities at initial recognition are \\nclassified as financial liabilities at amortized cost or \\nfinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, \\nas appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognised \\ninitially at fair value and, in the case of loans and \\nborrowings and payables, net of directly attributable \\ntransaction costs.\\n   Financial Liabilities classified as Amortised Cost\\n   All Financial Liabilities other than derivatives are \\nmeasured at amortised cost. Interest expense that is \\nnot capitalised as part of costs of assets is included as \\nFinance costs in Profit or Loss.\\n   Derecognition\\n   A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation \\nunder the liability is discharged / cancelled / expired. \\nWhen an existing financial liability is replaced by \\nanother from the same lender on substantially different \\nterms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially \\nmodified, such an exchange or modification is treated \\nas the derecognition of the original liability and the \\nrecognition of a new liability. The difference in the \\nrespective carrying amounts is recognised in profit or \\nloss.\\n   Derivatives\\n   Derivative instruments are initially recognised at fair \\nvalue on the date a derivative contract is entered into \\nand are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at \\nthe end of each reporting period.  The accounting for \\nsubsequent changes in fair value depends on whether \\nthe derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and \\nif so, the nature of the item being hedged and the type \\nof hedge relationship designated.  The resulting gain or \\nloss is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless \\nthe derivative is designated and effective as a hedging \\ninstrument and is recognised in Other Comprehensive \\nIncome (OCI).

Capital Management\\n For the purpose of Group’s Capital Management, capital includes Issued Equity Capital, Securities Premium, and all other Equity Reserves attributable to \\nthe Equity Holders of the Group. The primary objective of the Group’s Capital Management is to maximise the Share Holder Value.\\n The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in the light of changes in economic conditions and requirements of the financial \\ncovenants and to continue as a going concern. The Group monitors using a gearing ratio which is net debts divided by total capital plus net debt. The \\nGroup includes within net debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings, less cash and short term deposit.\\nB. Financial Risk Management\\n The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, lease liability, trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial \\nliabilities is to finance the operations of the Group. The principal financial assets include trade and other receivables, investments in mutual funds, Bonds, \\ncash and short term deposits.\\n The Group has assessed market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk to its financial instruments.\\n i) Market Risk\\n  Is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a financial instrument, as a result of interest \\nrates, foreign exchange rates and other price risks. Financial instruments affected by market risks, primarily include loans & borrowings, investments \\nand foreign currency receivables, payables and borrowings.\\n  a) Interest Rate Risk:\\n   The Group borrows funds in Indian Rupees and Foreign currency, to meet both the long term and short term funding requirements. The \\nInterest rate risk in terms of Foreign currency is managed through financial instruments available to convert floating rate liability into fixed \\nrate liability. The Group due to its  AAA rated status commands one of the cheapest source of funding. Interest rate is fixed for the tenor of \\nthe Long term loans availed by the Group. Interest on Short term borrowings is subject to floating interest rate and are repriced regularly. The \\nsensitivity analysis detailed below have been determined based on the exposure to variable interest rates on the average outstanding amounts \\ndue to bankers over a year. The Group had issued floating interest rate Non-convertible debentures linked to 6 month T-Bill rate, to meet long \\nterm funding requirements.\\n   If the interest rates had been 1% higher / lower and all other variables held constant, the Group’s profit for the year ended 31st March, 2024 \\nwould have been decreased/increased by ` 14.25  Crores (Previous year ` 16.56 Crores).\\n\\n192\\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST MARCH 2024\\n  b) Currency Risk:\\n   Foreign currency risks from financial instruments at the end of the reporting period expressed in INR :\\nUnhedged Short Term Exposures : (` Crores)\\n31.03.2024 31.03.2023\\nFinancial Assets  193.53  199.27 \\nFinancial Liabilites  324.21  179.76 \\n   The company is mainly exposed to changes in US Dollar.

Due to the significantly increased volatility of certain commodities like \\nNatural Rubber, Compound rubber, Synthetic Rubber and other Chemicals, the Group enters into purchase contracts on a short to medium \\nTerm and forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into to bring in stability of price fluctuations.\\n   The Group’s investments in Quoted and Unquoted Securities are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values \\nof investment securities. The Group manages the securities price risk through investments in debt funds and diversification by placing limits \\non individual and total investments.  Reports on Investment Portfolio are reviewed on regular basis and all approvals of investment decisions \\nare done in concurrence with the senior management.\\n   As at 31st March, 2024, the investments in debt mutual funds and bonds amounts to ` 3366.16 Crores (Previous year - ` 3071 Crores). A \\n1% point increase or decrease in the NAV with all other variables held constant would have lead to approximately an additional ` 34 Crores \\n(Previous year - ` 31 Crores) on either side in the statement of profit and loss.\\nii) Credit Risk\\n Is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Company. It arises from credit exposure to \\ncustomers, financial instruments viz., Investments in Equity Shares, Bonds, Debt Funds, Fixed Deposits others and Balances with Banks.\\n The Group’s marketing policies are well structured and all replacement sales are predominantly through dealers and the outstanding are secured by \\ndealer deposits.  As regards sales to O.E., and other institutional sales, the Group carries out periodic credit checks and also limits the exposure by \\nestablishing maximum payment period for customers and by offering prompt payment discounts.  The outstanding trade receivables due for a period \\nexceeding 180 days as at the year ended 31st March, 2024 is 0.02% (31st March, 2023 - 0.02%) of the total trade receivables.\\n\\n194\\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST MARCH 2024\\n The Group uses Expected Credit Loss  (ECL) Model   to assess the impairment loss or gain.

Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) are \\\\ninvesting in EV models and most of the new developments will be in this area. \\\\nTwo Wheeler production recorded a decline of 3%, the third consecutive year \\\\nof decline. The decline in Scooter production continues to be higher than \\\\nMotorcycles this year also. There were multiple price hikes over the last 2 \\\\nyears by Manufacturers. Entry level vehicles took the biggest volume hit being \\\\nthe segment most sensitive to price. Also, high fuel costs, poor rural sentiment \\\\netc kept Customers away. New launches have been subdued. Your company \\\\ncontinues to be the preferred choice of fitment in most of the new launches. \\\\nDuring the year, your company also launched quite a few new products for \\\\nafter market sales which have been well accepted by the customers. The \\\\nexcitement in the electric vehicle space continues with more players entering \\\\nthe segment and volumes more than doubling.\\\\nTwo wheelers performed well in Exports which came as a relief to companies \\\\nthat were impacted by demand pressure in the domestic markets. \\\\nTractor Production in financial year 2022 was flat despite the first half showing \\\\ngood growth. Substantial increase in fuel costs, raw material and labour costs \\\\nimpacted the off-take of Tractors in financial year 2022. Farmers are benefiting \\\\nfrom high prices of commodities, specially of Wheat and Oilseeds resulting\",\"35\\\\nMANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\\\n(Within the limits set by Company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s competitive position)\\\\nThe year 2021-22 was another challenging year for India and the World, \\\\nhaving to deal with the 2nd Covid wave at the beginning of the year and the \\\\nmilder Omicron wave later in the year. The year saw inflation rising through \\\\nthe year, primarily due to high commodity and energy prices. As the World \\\\nEconomy was recovering from the impact of Covid, came the war in Ukraine. \\\\nThe war aggravated an already high inflation in the global economy while \\\\ndislocating supply chains further. The Organization for Economic Co-operation \\\\nand Development (OECD) estimates that the War in Ukraine could shave-off \\\\na percentage point from global growth. Debt level of Countries has gone up \\\\nwhile some Countries are grappling with foreign exchange crisis. Central \\\\nBanks around the world have started tightening monetary conditions to rein \\\\nin inflation. Developing Countries have limited space for additional fiscal \\\\nspending in view of the elevated spending of the past two years to combat \\\\nthe impact of Covid. Consequently, global growth is set to moderate. MRF \\\\ncontinued its leadership journey in this challenging year and continues to be \\\\nranked among the World\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Top 20 Tyre manufacturers. \\\\nGlobal economy grew by an estimated 6.1% in 2021 (IMF World Economic \\\\nOutlook, April 2022), reflecting the base impact of the previous year (-3.1%)\"],\"source_documents\":[\"Annual-Report-2022.pdf\"],\"source_sections\":[\"MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\"]}'\n"
