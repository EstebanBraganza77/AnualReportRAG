The projects cover a broad range \\nof comprehensive scientific understanding on the \\n‘interfaces and interphases’ of tyres, materials and \\ndesign aspects on the noise-vibration-harshness (NVH) \\naspects, exploration of novel- and sustainable materials \\n(bio-derived and circular), advancement of simulation \\ncapability, and nano- and nanostructured materials with \\nthe overall stated aim of the company to continuously \\nadvance green and sustainable tyre technologies. \\nThe joint R&D programs resulted in PhD degrees, \\ninternational publications and patents.  \\n  b. New product and material development, elimination of \\nhazardous materials, etc.:\\n   To improve sustainability of products, our company \\nis working on the multipronged 4R strategy of reduce, \\nrecycle, reuse and renewable. Our “Reduce” strategy \\nimplies achieving a reduction in the carbon footprint \\nduring the usage phase through a reduction in the rolling \\nresistance of tyres as well as a carbon footprint reduction \\nby ‘materials’ conservation’ through reduced usage of \\nraw materials (light-weighted tyres). The “Recycle” \\nstrategy involves promoting the usage of recycled \\nmaterials from waste and recovered materials from \\nend-of-life tyres as circular raw materials for new tyres. \\nThe focus of the “Reuse” methodology is on materials \\nand energy conservation through designing multiple \\nretreadable tyres and promoting the retreading process \\nby own networks, and the “Renewable” strategy implies \\nusage of sustainable raw materials from renewable \\nsources such as biomass. \\n   Towards import substitution, we have initiated joint \\ndevelopment programs with domestic suppliers for raw \\nmaterials such as sulphur, accelerators, antioxidants, \\nbutyl rubber, halobutyl rubber, microcrystalline wax, \\nsuper tackifier resin, performance resins, anti-reversion \\nagents, filler coupling / process agents, etc.'),\n",

World \\neconomy moved towards a soft landing with growth holding up and \\ninflation declining. MRF continued its industry leading growth in the \\ndomestic market.\\nEconomic growth was steady during the year despite monetary tightening, \\nwarnings of recession and impact of climate related events. Global trade \\nwas muted with increased geo economic fragmentation, trade restrictions \\nand lower consumption arising from tight financial conditions. Emerging \\neconomies performed better than the developed world. There was \\nsteady reduction in inflation in both developed and emerging economies \\nprompting Central Banks to pause interest rate hikes, though inflation is still \\nabove the target in most economies. Geo political issues continued causing \\ndisturbance to the world with the continuing Ukraine war, tensions in West \\nAsia and disturbances to commercial shipping in the Red Sea.\\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates show that World Economy \\ngrew by 3.2% in calendar year 2023 bettering its own earlier estimates. \\nIMF estimates that growth in 2024 would be similar to 2023. Inflation \\nis expected to decline steadily.Geopolitical disturbances could impact \\ninflation trajectory and delay central Bank policy easing, with adverse \\neffects on global growth. Rate cuts by Central Banks is now expected to \\nbe in the 2nd half of 2024.\\nMarket & Industry Overview\\nGrowth surprised on the upside for Indian economy over the quarters, \\ndriven by investment. Despite a difficult external sector and weakness in \\nagriculture arising from a patchy monsoon, Indian economy performed \\nwell riding on the strength of its domestic demand. Government of India’s \\nadvance estimates of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for 2023-24 shows a \\ngrowth at 7.6%. India continued to remain the fastest growing economy. \\nGrowth was led by manufacturing and construction. \\nPrivate consumption was weak as in the previous year, owing to lower \\nrural demand while urban demand was robust. There are early signs that \\nprivate investment is picking up, responding to growth in the economy. \\nIndia’s merchandise exports declined by 3% while total exports, including \\nservices, was at the same level as the previous year. Geo political issues \\nand weakened consumer demand impacted exports. But trade deficit was \\nlower by more than 9% as imports too contracted. Exports of electronics \\nwere a bright spot. \\nNon-food Inflation fell by 2.5% during the year (April,2023 to \\nJanuary,2024) while food inflation rose by 0.40% in the same period. \\nIndia has managed to deliver on both growth and inflation management.  \\nThe Government struck to the path of fiscal consolidation in the vote on \\naccount that was presented. Continuing with the thrust on capex, capital \\nexpenditure outlay was hiked by 11%. \\nIndian Government securities is set to be included in the emerging markets \\nbond index by Morgan Stanley and other financial institutions, reflecting \\nconfidence in the India growth story and the financial system. This move \\npaves the way for dollar inflows into the country’s sovereign debt market \\nand reduction of borrowing costs in the economy.  \\nIndia Meteorological Department (IMD) has projected an above normal \\nmonsoon for the year which should improve rural growth and consumption. \\nGrowth in financial year 2023-2024 came from Government spending \\nand high end consumption with only a marginal growth in agriculture. \\nA good monsoon should add to the growth of the economy in financial \\nyear 2024-25. Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has projected financial year \\n2024-25 GDP growth at 7% while IMF has projected the same at 6.8%.  \\nGlobal car sales grew by 10% in calendar year 2023 after a flat growth \\nin 2022. Electric car sales grew more than a third. Adoption of Electric \\nVehicles (EV) continued across markets. High vehicle costs and high \\ninterest rates were a pain point for the Industry. \\nIndian automobile industry performed well in financial year 2024 with \\ndomestic sales showing a growth of 12.5% (source: Society of Indian \\nAutomobile Manufacturers (SIAM)). Passenger vehicle segment and two \\nwheeler segment led the growth while commercial vehicles managed \\nto grow only marginally. Tractors were a weak spot as irregular rains \\nimpacted demand. In the passenger segment, share of entry level vehicles \\ncontinued to shrink. Demand revival was seen for entry level two wheelers \\nduring festive season and also in the last quarter of financial year 2023-24.'),\n",

There was sizeable drop in sales in commercial vehicles, \\ntwo wheelers and three wheelers while export of passenger vehicles grew \\nmarginally (source: SIAM). \\nThe production of Medium and Heavy Commercial Vehicle (M&HCV) \\nduring the year has seen a very marginal growth. The bus sales that was \\nimpacted during the Covid period is bouncing back. The trailer segment \\nis also seeing a growth every year fuelled by loading restrictions in many \\nmarkets. Electric vehicles have till now been predominantly in the bus \\nsegment operated by the state transport undertakings. Various regulatory \\nnorms are expected to be implemented during the year 2024-25 and \\nthe Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEMs) have been gearing up for \\nthe same. As a result of this, the tyre performance criteria of OEMs have \\nundergone considerable changes. \\nQuite a few new products were launched by us both in the bias and radial \\nsegment. This has helped us further consolidate our position with both the \\nOEM and in after sales markets.\\nThe current indications are that the first half of 2024-25 would be sluggish \\nand even with an anticipated recovery in the second half, the OEM \\nproduction is expected to continue to be flat if not marginally negative.  \\nThe passenger vehicle production has seen a growth of 7% in the year \\nended March,2024. Domestic  sales also recorded  yet again the highest \\never sale in a financial year. The segment continued to witness preference \\nfor Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs), which has now a share of more \\nthan 50% in overall sales. Despite price increases, better supplies and \\nsustained consumer demand, especially for SUVs, supported sales. The \\nwaiting period for many car models have come down and the stocks have \\nimproved in the dealerships. The shift to electric vehicle has intensified \\nfew years ago and continues this year as well.\\nTwo wheeler production showed growth for the second consecutive \\nyear. Motorcycle and scooter production saw good growth during the \\nyear. However, it is yet to reach the pre-Covid levels. In motorcycles, \\nthe 125 cc and above segment is showing a higher growth in production \\nand currently accounts for more than a third of the total production. A \\nslew of product launches by various OEMs were seen in the segment with \\nhigher cubic capacity (cc).  Growth has been fuelled by domestic sales \\nand exports continues to be sluggish. The year also saw the entry of one of \\nthe prominent OEMs into the 100 cc motorcycle segment.  \\nYour Company continues to be a preferred choice of fitment of OEMs \\nin most of their new launches. Many OEMs increased their fitment of \\nour tyres on their existing models also. During the year, the Company \\nlaunched ‘W’ rated Steel belted motorcycle radial tyres for the high \\nperformance segment, under the brand name ‘Steel Brace’. The Company \\nhas also further strengthened its after market portfolio with new products \\nboth in the motorcycle and scooter segment. \\nDuring the year, the government reduced the subsidies under the FAME 2 \\nscheme for electric vehicles which had a short-term impact on their sales. \\nSubsequently the tenure of the FAME 2 scheme also ended in March,2024. \\nThe new Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme has been announced for the \\nperiod 1st April, 2024 to 30th July, 2024.\\nTractor Production had shown a decline of 11% in the financial year \\n2023-24. A trend was observed among Tractor OEMs of bringing out \\nnewer lower HP and light weight tractor models. Tractor OEMs have \\nstarted planning for electric tractors in the near term. During the year, \\nthe Company was able to improve and consolidate its market share in \\nTractor OEMs. Farm mechanization is growing in India, with increased \\nusage of laser leveller, rotavators, reapers, paddy transplanters and \\nharvesters among farmers. This can lead to significant usage of higher \\nHP tractors in India in the near future. In the replacement segment, your \\nCompany continues to be the most preferred brand in the market place. \\nReplacement sales had shown considerable buoyancy this year. IMD has \\nforecasted an above normal monsoon during the coming season which \\nwould help revive the farming sector in financial year 2024-25. \\nTyre Industry posted a moderate growth in the financial year 2023-24 \\nin comparison to the previous year. Recovery in the second half of the \\nyear helped Exports to retain previous year’s figures. Further, lower raw \\nmaterial prices enabled the industry to show improved profit margins.\\nProduct wise Performance\\nDuring fiscal 2023-24, your Company achieved a total income of ` 24,986 \\ncrores.

Above average monsoon forecasted \\nshould improve rural demand and will be a tailwind for high growth in the \\neconomy. Inflation is moving towards RBI’s target of 4% even though food \\ninflation is sticky. Possible reduction in interest rates by RBI in the second \\nhalf would further aid growth and capital spend. Private sector capital \\ncapex should get a boost from demand increase and potential interest \\ncost reduction.\\nFood inflation has not shown a meaningful improvement in the last year. \\nExtreme weather events can keep food inflation elevated which may \\ninfluence RBI’s decision on interest rates. Geo political issues can cause \\nprice of Oil and other commodities to spike up.  In financial year 2024, \\nCorporates benefited from lower commodity prices. Commodity and \\nenergy prices have spiked in recent weeks.  \\nGrowth has so far been mainly driven by Government investments but \\nthe pace of public investments is set to slow as Government lowers its \\nfiscal deficit target.

Key things to look out for would be a broad based \\nimprovement in consumption growth and meaningful improvement in \\nprivate investment.       \\nOutlook\\nCommercial vehicles is likely to show muted growth in the current year. \\nGrowth of passenger vehicles may moderate considering the high base \\nand strong growth in the last 3 years.

Basis for Opinion\\n We conducted our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements \\nin accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified \\nunder Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those \\nStandards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for \\nthe Audit of the Standalone  Financial Statements section of our \\nreport. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the \\nCode of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of \\nIndia (ICAI) together with the independence requirements that are \\nrelevant to our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements under \\nthe provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have \\nfulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these \\nrequirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the \\naudit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to \\nprovide a basis for our audit opinion on the Standalone Financial \\nStatements.\\n3. Emphasis of Matter\\n We draw attention to Note 28((q(i)(a)) to the Standalone Financial \\nStatement which describe the following matter :\\n In terms of the Order dated 31st August 2018 the Competition \\nCommission of India (CCI) has on 2nd February 2022 released its \\nOrder imposing penalty on the Company concerning the breach of \\nprovisions of the Competition Act, 2002 during the year 2011-2012 \\nand imposed a penalty of ` 622.09 Crores on the Company.  The \\nappeal filed by the Company has been disposed of by the National \\nCompany Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in December 2022, by \\nremanding the matter to CCI for review after hearing the parties.  CCI \\nhas in February 2023 filed an appeal against the Order of NCLAT \\nbefore the Hon’ble Supreme Court. Pending disposal, the Company \\nhas filed an appeal before the Hon’ble Supreme Court against the \\norder of NCLAT, which has been tagged with the appeal filed by CCI \\nin the Supreme Court. The Company is of the view that no provision \\nis considered necessary in respect of this matter in the Standalone \\nFinancial Results.\\n Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\\n4. Key Audit Matters \\n Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional \\njudgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial \\nstatements of the current year. These matters were addressed in \\nthe context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and \\nin forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate \\nopinion on these matters.'),\n",

Due to the size of these schemes, small \\nchanges in these assumptions can have a material \\nimpact on the estimated defined benefit obligation\\nOur audit procedures included: \\nWe have examined the key controls over the process involving member data, formulation \\nof assumptions and the financial reporting process in arriving at the provision for retirement \\nbenefits.  We tested the controls for determining the actuarial assumptions and the approval \\nof those assumptions by senior management. We found these key controls were designed, \\nimplemented and operated effectively, and therefore determined that we could place reliance \\non these key controls for the purposes of our audit.\\nWe tested the employee data used in calculating the obligation and  where material, we also \\nconsidered the treatment of curtailments, settlements, past service costs, remeasurements, \\nbenefits paid, and any other amendments made to obligations during the year. From the evidence \\nobtained, we found the data and assumptions used by management in the actuarial valuations \\nfor retirement benefit obligations to be appropriate.\\n2\\nProvision for Sales related obligations\\nThe Company makes an estimated provision for \\nsales related obligations based on commitments, \\nestablished trade practices, historical trends and \\nother assumptions which are judgemental including \\nthose relating to outflow of resources.\\nConsidering the significant judgements involved in \\nmaking the above estimate, we have considered this \\nas a key audit matter. \\nOur audit procedures included: \\nWe understood and tested the controls over the assumptions applied in arriving at the provision \\nfor Sales related obligations.  \\nTested on sample basis, the provision made during the year with relevant data elements, \\nassumptions involved,  validation of formula used in the spread sheet and  management review \\nand control of the relevant internal and external factors impacting the provision.\\n3 Provision for Extended Producer Responsibility \\n(EPR)\\n(Refer Note 28 j) \\nThe Company has recognised provision towards EPR \\nobligations based on the notification issued by the \\nMinistry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.  \\nThe obligation is to be met by purchasing certificates \\nfrom Recyclers and the provision is estimated based \\non current cost estimate.  \\nGiven the inherent complexity and the magnitude of \\nthe potential exposures and judgements necessary \\nto estimate the amount of provision required and to \\ndetermine required disclosures, we have considered \\nthis as a key audit matter.\\nOur audit procedures included: \\nWe have obtained an understanding on the requirement of the notification and of the process \\nfollowed by the Company for assessment and determination of the amount of provision required \\n/ recognized and the appropriateness of the disclosures made in the financial statements.'),\n",

A \\nCompany’s internal financial control with reference to Standalone \\nFinancial Statements includes those policies and procedures \\nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable \\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions \\nof the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance \\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation \\nof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted \\naccounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the \\nCompany are being made only in accordance with authorisations \\nof management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide \\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of \\nunauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s \\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\n5. INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS \\nWITH REFERENCE TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls \\nwith reference to Standalone Financial Statements, including \\nthe possibility of collusion or improper management override of \\ncontrols, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur \\nand not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the \\ninternal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial \\nStatements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal \\nfinancial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements \\nmay become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that \\nthe degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may \\ndeteriorate.\\nFor M.M.

The estimates \\nand underlying assumptions are reviewed on ongoing basis. \\nRevisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period \\nin which the estimates are revised if the revision affects only \\nthat period or in the period of revision and future periods if the \\nrevision affects both current and future period.\\n  The few critical estimations and judgments made in applying \\naccounting policies are:\\n Property, Plant and Equipment/Intangible Assets:\\n Useful life of Property, Plant and Equipment are as specified in \\nSchedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 and on certain intangible \\nassets based on technical advice which considered the nature of \\nthe asset, the usage of the asset, expected physical wear and tear,'),\n",

The \\nCompany reviews the useful life of Property, Plant and Equipment \\nand intangible assets at the end of each reporting period. This \\nreassessment may result in change in depreciation charge in future \\nperiods (Refer Note 1 (C 1)).\\n Impairment of Non-financial Assets:\\n For calculating the recoverable amount of non-financial assets, the \\nCompany is required to estimate the value-in-use of the asset or the \\nCash Generating Unit and the fair value less costs to disposal. For \\ncalculating value in use the Company is required to estimate the \\ncash flows to be generated from using the asset. The fair value of \\nan asset is estimated using a valuation technique where observable \\nprices are not available. Further, the discount rate used in value in \\nuse calculations includes an estimate of risk assessment specific to \\nthe asset. \\n Impairment of Financial Assets:\\n The Company impairs financial assets other than those measured \\nat fair value through profit or loss or designated at fair value \\nthrough other comprehensive income on expected credit losses. \\nThe estimation of expected credit loss includes the estimation \\nof probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and the \\nexposure at default (EAD). Estimation of probability of default apart \\nfrom involving trend analysis of past delinquency rates includes an \\nestimation on forward-looking information relating to not only the \\ncounterparty but also relating to the industry and the economy as a \\nwhole. The probability of default is estimated for the entire life of the \\ncontract by estimating the cash flows that are likely to be received \\nin default scenario. The lifetime PD is reduced to 12 months PD \\nbased on an assessment of past history of default cases in 12 months. \\nFurther, the loss given default is calculated based on an estimate of \\nthe value of the security recoverable as on the reporting date. The \\nexposure at default is the amount outstanding at the balance sheet \\ndate (Refer Note 1(C 10)).\\n Defined Benefit Plans:\\n The cost of the defined benefit plan and other post-employment \\nbenefits and the present value of such obligations are determined \\nusing actuarial valuations.  An actuarial valuation involves making \\nvarious assumptions that may differ from actual developments in \\nthe future.  These include the determination of the discount rate, \\nfuture salary increases, mortality rates and attrition rate.  Due to \\nthe complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, \\na defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these \\nassumptions.  All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date \\n(Refer Note 28 (f)).\\n Fair Value Measurement of Financial Instruments:\\n When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities \\nrecorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted \\nprices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation \\ntechniques including the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model.  The \\ninputs to these models are taken from observable markets where \\npossible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is \\nrequired in establishing fair values (Refer Note 1 (C10)).\\n Income Taxes:\\n Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision for \\nincome taxes, including amount expected to be paid/recovered for \\nuncertain tax positions (Refer Note 1 (C 9)).\\n In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, \\nmanagement considers whether some portion or all of the deferred \\nincome tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of \\ndeferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future \\ntaxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences \\nbecome deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals \\nof deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income \\nand tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the \\nlevel of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable \\nincome over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are \\ndeductible, management believes that the Company will realize the \\nbenefits of those deductible differences.

Financial instruments affected by market risks, primarily include loans & borrowings, investments \\nand foreign currency receivables, payables and borrowings.\\n  a) Interest Rate Risk : \\n   The Company borrows funds in Indian Rupees to meet both the long term and short term funding requirements. The Company due to its  \\nAAA rated status commands one of the cheapest source of funding.  Interest rate is fixed for the tenor of the Long term loans availed by the \\nCompany. Interest on Short term borrowings is subject to floating interest rate and are repriced regularly. The sensitivity analysis detailed \\nbelow have been determined based on the exposure to variable interest rates on the average outstanding amounts due to bankers over a \\nyear. The Company had issued floating interest rate Non convertible debenture linked to 6 month T-Bill rate, to meet the long term funding \\nrequirements. \\n   If the interest rates had been 1% higher / lower and all other variables held constant, the Company’s profit for the year ended 31st March, \\n2024 would have been decreased/increased by ` 8.14 Crores (Previous year - ` 10.66 Crores).\\n  b) Currency Risk : \\n   Foreign currency risks from financial instruments at the end of the reporting period expressed in INR :\\nUnhedged Short Term Exposures : (` Crores)\\n31.03.2024 31.03.2023\\nFinancial Assets/Other assets  193.53  199.27 \\nFinancial Liabilites/ Other Liabilities  324.21  179.76 \\n   The company is mainly exposed to changes in US Dollar.

It arises from credit exposure to \\ncustomers, financial instruments viz., Investments in Equity Shares, Bonds, Debt Funds, Fixed Deposits Others and Balances with Banks.\\n The Company’s marketing policies are well structured and all replacement sales are predominantly through dealers and the outstanding are secured by \\ndealer deposits.  As regards sales to O.E., and other institutional sales, the Company carries out periodic credit checks and also limits the exposure by \\nestablishing maximum payment period for customers and by offering prompt payment discounts. The outstanding trade receivables due for a period \\nexceeding 180 days as at the year ended 31st March, 2024 is 0.02% (31st March, 2023 0.02%) of the total trade receivables. \\n There are no transactions with single customer which amounts to 10% or more of the Company’s revenue. \\n The company uses Expected Credit Loss (ECL) Model to assess the impairment loss or gain.

The results of \\nsensitivity analysis is given below:\\n(` Crores)\\nParticulars As at  \\n31.03.2024\\nAs at  \\n31.03.2023\\nDefined Benefit Obligation (Base)  562.49  484.47 \\nParticulars As at \\n31.03.2024\\nAs at \\n31.03.2023\\nDecrease Increase Decrease Increase\\nDiscount Rate (- / + 1%)  616.07  516.29  530.74  444.60 \\n(% change compared to base due to sensitivity) 9.50% -8.20% 9.60% -8.20%\\nSalary Growth Rate (- / + 1%)  515.12  616.49  443.48  531.27 \\n(% change compared to base due to sensitivity) -8.40% 9.60% -8.50% 9.70%\\nAttrition Rate (- / + 50%)  560.15  564.62  481.65  487.04 \\n(% change compared to base due to sensitivity) -0.40% 0.40% -0.60% 0.50%\\nMortality Rate (- / + 10%)  561.61  563.36  483.67  485.27 \\n(% change compared to base due to sensitivity) -0.20% 0.20% -0.20% 0.20%\\n       Please note that the sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined \\nbenefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the \\nassumptions may be correlated.\\n       There is no change in the method of valuation from the prior period.

Opinion\\n We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Financial \\nStatements of MRF Limited (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Holding \\nCompany”) and its subsidiaries (Holding Company and its \\nsubsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”) which comprise \\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2024, and \\nthe Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other \\nComprehensive Income),  the Consolidated Statement of Changes \\nin Equity and the Consolidated Cash Flows Statement for the year \\nended on that date and notes to financial statements, a summary \\nof material accounting policies and other explanatory information \\n(hereinafter referred to as “the Consolidated Financial Statements”).\\n In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to \\nthe explanations given to us, the aforesaid Consolidated Financial \\nStatements give the information required by the Companies Act, \\n2013 (“the Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and \\nfair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind \\nAS) prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with Companies \\n(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended and \\nother accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the \\nConsolidated state of affairs (financial position) of the Group as at \\n31st March, 2024, and its Consolidated profit (financial performance \\nincluding Other Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated Changes \\nin Equity and its Consolidated Cash Flows for the year ended on that \\ndate.\\n2. Basis for Opinion\\n We conducted our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements \\nin accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified \\nunder Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those \\nStandards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for \\nthe Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our \\nreport. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the \\nCode of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of \\nIndia (ICAI) together with the independence requirements that are \\nrelevant to our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements under \\nthe provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have \\nfulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these \\nrequirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the \\naudit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to \\nprovide a basis for our audit opinion on the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements.\\n3. Emphasis of Matter\\n We draw attention to Note 25 (j) (a) to the Consolidated Financial \\nStatement which describe the following matter:\\n In terms of the Order dated 31st August 2018 the Competition \\nCommission of India (CCI) has on 2nd February 2022 released its Order \\nimposing penalty on the Holding Company concerning the breach of \\nprovisions of the Competition Act, 2002 during the year 2011-2012 \\nand imposed a penalty of ` 622.09 Crores on the Holding Company.  \\nThe appeal filed by the Holding Company has been disposed of by \\nthe National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in December \\n2022, by remanding the matter to CCI for review after hearing the \\nparties.  CCI has in February 2023 filed an appeal against the Order \\nof NCLAT before the Hon’ble Supreme Court. Pending disposal, the \\nHolding Company has filed an appeal before the Hon’ble Supreme \\nCourt against the order of NCLAT, which has been tagged with the \\nappeal filed by CCI in the Supreme Court. The Holding Company is \\nof the view that no provision is considered necessary in respect of this \\nmatter in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\\n4. Key Audit Matters \\n Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, \\nwere of most significance in our audit of the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the \\ncontext of our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements as a \\nwhole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide \\na separate opinion on these matters.'),\n",

Due to the size of these schemes, \\nsmall changes in these assumptions can have a \\nmaterial impact on the estimated defined benefit \\nobligation.\\nOur audit procedures included: \\nWe have examined the key controls over the process involving member data, formulation of \\nassumptions and the financial reporting process in arriving at the provision for retirement benefits.  \\nWe tested the controls for determining the actuarial assumptions and the approval of those \\nassumptions by senior management. We found these key controls were designed, implemented \\nand operated effectively, and therefore determined that we could place reliance on these key \\ncontrols for the purposes of our audit.\\nWe tested the employee data used in calculating the obligation and  where material, we also \\nconsidered the treatment of curtailments, settlements, past service costs, remeasurements, \\nbenefits paid, and any other amendments made to obligations during the year. From the evidence \\nobtained, we found the data and assumptions used by management in the actuarial valuations for \\nretirement benefit obligations to be appropriate.\\n2 Provision for Sales related obligations\\nThe Holding Company makes an estimated provision \\nfor sales related obligations based on commitments, \\nestablished trade practices, historical trends and \\nother assumptions which are judgemental including \\nthose relating to outflow of resources.\\nConsidering the significant judgements involved in \\nmaking the above estimate, we have considered this \\nas a key audit matter. \\nOur audit procedures included: \\nWe understood and tested the controls over the assumptions applied in arriving at the provision \\nfor Sales related obligations.  \\nTested on sample basis, the provision made during the year with relevant data elements, \\nassumptions involved,  validation of formula used in the spread sheet and  management review \\nand control of the relevant internal and external factors impacting the provision.\\n3 Provision for Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) \\n(Refer Note 25 k) \\nThe Holding Company has recognised provision \\ntowards EPR obligations based on the notification \\nissued by the Ministry of Environment, Forest \\nand Climate Change.  The obligation is to be met \\nby purchasing certificates from Recyclers and \\nthe provision is estimated based on current cost \\nestimate.  \\nGiven the inherent complexity and the magnitude of \\nthe potential exposures and judgements necessary \\nto estimate the amount of provision required and to \\ndetermine required disclosures, we have considered \\nthis as a key audit matter.\\nOur audit procedures included: \\nWe have obtained an understanding on the requirement of the notification and of the process \\nfollowed by the Holding Company for assessment and determination of the amount of provision \\nrequired / recognized and the appropriateness of the disclosures made in the Consolidated \\nfinancial statements.'),\n",

MEANING OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS WITH \\nREFERENCE TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n A company’s internal financial control with reference to \\nConsolidated Financial Statements is a process designed to provide \\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting \\nand the preparation of financial statements for external purposes \\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A \\ncompany’s internal financial control with reference to Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements includes those policies and procedures \\nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable \\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions \\nof the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance \\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation \\nof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted \\naccounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the \\ncompany are being made only in accordance with authorisations \\nof management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide \\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of \\nunauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s \\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\n4. INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS \\nWITH REFERENCE TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial control \\nwith reference to Consolidated Financial Statements including \\nthe possibility of collusion or improper management override of \\ncontrols, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur \\nand not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the \\ninternal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial \\nStatements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal \\nfinancial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements \\nmay become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that \\nthe degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may \\ndeteriorate.\\n5.

Control is achieved when the Holding Company is \\nexposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement \\nwith the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through \\nits power over the investee. Specifically, the Holding Company \\ncontrols an investee if and only if the Holding Company has:\\n\\t •\\t Power\\t over\\tthe\\tinvestee\\t(i.e.\\texisting\\trights\\tthat\\tgive\\tit\\tthe\\t\\ncurrent ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee),\\n\\t •\\t Exposure,\\t or\\trights,\\tto\\tvariable\\treturns\\tfrom\\tits\\tinvolvement\\t\\nwith the investee, and\\n\\t •\\t The\\t ability\\tto\\tuse\\tits\\tpower\\tover\\tthe\\tinvestee\\tto\\taffect\\tits\\t\\nreturns.\\n Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights \\nresult in control. To support this presumption and when the Holding \\nCompany has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of \\nan investee, the Holding Company considers all relevant facts and \\ncircumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, \\nincluding:\\n\\t •\\t The\\t contractual\\tarrangement\\twith\\tthe\\tother\\tvote\\tholders\\tof\\tthe\\t\\ninvestee.\\n\\t •\\t Rights\\tarising\\tfrom\\tother\\tcontractual\\tarrangements.\\n\\t •\\t The\\t Holding\\tCompany’s\\tvoting\\trights\\tand\\tpotential\\tvoting\\t\\nrights.\\n\\t •\\t The\\t size\\tof\\tthe\\tHolding\\tCompany’s\\tholding\\tof\\tvoting\\trights\\t\\nrelative to the size and dispersion of the holdings of the other \\nvoting rights holders.\\n The Holding Company re-assesses whether or not it controls an \\ninvestee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes \\nto one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of \\na Subsidiary begins when the Holding Company obtains control \\nover the Subsidiary and ceases when the Holding Company loses \\ncontrol of the Subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of \\na Subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included \\nin the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date the Holding \\nCompany gains control until the date the Holding Company ceases \\nto control the Subsidiary.\\n Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared using uniform \\naccounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar \\ncircumstances.

Major Sources of Estimation Uncertainty \\n  In the application of accounting policy which are described in \\npara (D) below, the management is required to make judgment, \\nestimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets \\nand liabilities, income and expenses, contingent liabilities and \\nthe accompanying disclosures that are not readily apparent \\nfrom other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions \\nare based on historical experience and other factors that are \\nconsidered to be relevant and are prudent and reasonable.  \\nActual results may differ from those estimates. The estimates \\nand underlying assumptions are reviewed on ongoing basis. \\nRevisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period \\nin which the estimates are revised if the revision affects only \\nthat period or in the period of revision and future periods if the \\nrevision affects both current and future period.\\n  The few critical estimations and judgments made in applying \\naccounting policies are:\\n  Property, Plant and Equipment/Intangible Assets:\\n  Useful life of Property, Plant and Equipment are as specified \\nin Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 and on certain \\nintangible assets based on technical advice which considered \\nthe nature of the asset, the usage of the asset, expected \\nphysical wear and tear, the operating conditions of the asset, \\nanticipated technological changes, manufacturers warranties \\nand maintenance support. The Group reviews the useful life \\nof Property, Plant and Equipment at the end of each reporting \\nperiod. This reassessment may result in change in depreciation \\ncharge in future periods. (Refer Note 1 (D 1))\\n  Impairment of Non-financial Assets:\\n  For calculating the recoverable amount of non-financial assets, \\nthe Group is required to estimate the value-in-use of the asset \\nor the Cash Generating Unit and the fair value less costs to \\ndisposal. For calculating value in use the Group is required \\nto estimate the cash flows to be generated from using the \\nasset. The fair value of an asset is estimated using a valuation \\ntechnique where observable prices are not available. Further, \\nthe discount rate used in value in use calculations includes an \\nestimate of risk assessment specific to the asset. \\n  Impairment of Financial Assets:\\n  The Group impairs financial assets other than those measured \\nat fair value through profit or loss or designated at fair value \\nthrough other comprehensive income on expected credit \\nlosses. The estimation of expected credit loss includes the \\nestimation of probability of default (PD), loss given default \\n(LGD) and the exposure at default (EAD). Estimation of \\nprobability of default apart from involving trend analysis of \\npast delinquency rates include an estimation on forward-\\nlooking information relating to not only the counterparty but \\nalso relating to the industry and the economy as a whole. \\nThe probability of default is estimated for the entire life of \\nthe contract by estimating the cash flows that are likely to \\nbe received in default scenario. The lifetime PD is reduced \\nto 12 months PD based on an assessment of past history of'),\n",

Further, the loss given default is \\ncalculated based on an estimate of the value of the security \\nrecoverable as on the reporting date. The exposure at default \\nis the amount outstanding at the balance sheet date. (Refer \\nNote 1 (D 10))\\n  Defined Benefit Plans:\\n  The cost of the defined benefit plan and other post-\\nemployment benefits and the present value of such obligations \\nare determined using actuarial valuations.  An actuarial \\nvaluation involves making various assumptions that may differ \\nfrom actual developments in the future.  These include the \\ndetermination of the discount rate, future salary increases, \\nmortality rates and attrition rate.  Due to the complexities \\ninvolved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined \\nbenefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these \\nassumptions.  All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting \\ndate.\\n  Fair Value Measurement of Financial Instruments:\\n  When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities \\nrecorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on \\nquoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured \\nusing valuation techniques including the Discounted Cash \\nFlow (DCF) model.  The inputs to these models are taken \\nfrom observable markets where possible, but where this is \\nnot feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing \\nfair values. Judgments include considerations of inputs \\nsuch as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility.  Changes in \\nassumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair \\nvalue of financial instruments. (Refer Note 1 (D 10))\\n  Income Taxes\\n  Significant judgments are involved in determining the \\nprovision for income taxes, including amount expected to be \\npaid/recovered for uncertain tax positions. (Refer Note 1 (D 9))\\n  In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, \\nmanagement considers whether some portion or all of the \\ndeferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate \\nrealization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon \\nthe generation of future taxable income during the periods \\nin which the temporary differences become deductible. \\nManagement considers the scheduled reversals of deferred \\nincome tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax \\nplanning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the \\nlevel of historical taxable income and projections for future \\ntaxable income over the periods in which the deferred income \\ntax assets are deductible, management believes that the \\ngroup will realize the benefits of those deductible differences. \\nThe amount of the deferred income tax assets considered \\nrealizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if \\nestimates of future taxable income during the carry forward \\nperiod are reduced.\\n  Leases\\n  Ind AS 116 requires lessees to determine the lease term as the \\nnon-cancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option \\nto extend or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is \\nreasonably certain. The Group makes an assessment on the \\nexpected lease term on a lease-by-lease basis and thereby \\nassesses whether it is reasonably certain that any options \\nto extend or terminate the contract will be exercised. In \\nevaluating the lease term, the Group considers factors such as \\nany significant leasehold improvements undertaken over the \\nlease term, costs relating to the termination of the lease and \\nthe importance of the underlying asset to Group’s operations \\ntaking into account the location of the underlying asset and \\nthe availability of suitable alternatives. The lease term in future \\nperiods is reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the \\ncurrent economic circumstances.  After considering current \\nand future economic conditions, the Group concludes that no \\nchanges are required to lease period relating to the existing \\nlease contracts.

When the level \\nof discount varies with increase in levels of revenue \\ntransactions, the Group recognises the liability based \\non its estimate of the customer’s future purchases using \\nexpected value method. The Group recognises changes \\nin the estimated amounts of obligations for discounts \\nin the period in which the change occurs.

Capital Management\\n For the purpose of Group’s Capital Management, capital includes Issued Equity Capital, Securities Premium, and all other Equity Reserves attributable to \\nthe Equity Holders of the Group. The primary objective of the Group’s Capital Management is to maximise the Share Holder Value.\\n The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in the light of changes in economic conditions and requirements of the financial \\ncovenants and to continue as a going concern. The Group monitors using a gearing ratio which is net debts divided by total capital plus net debt. The \\nGroup includes within net debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings, less cash and short term deposit.\\nB. Financial Risk Management\\n The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, lease liability, trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial \\nliabilities is to finance the operations of the Group. The principal financial assets include trade and other receivables, investments in mutual funds, Bonds, \\ncash and short term deposits.\\n The Group has assessed market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk to its financial instruments.\\n i) Market Risk\\n  Is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a financial instrument, as a result of interest \\nrates, foreign exchange rates and other price risks. Financial instruments affected by market risks, primarily include loans & borrowings, investments \\nand foreign currency receivables, payables and borrowings.\\n  a) Interest Rate Risk:\\n   The Group borrows funds in Indian Rupees and Foreign currency, to meet both the long term and short term funding requirements. The \\nInterest rate risk in terms of Foreign currency is managed through financial instruments available to convert floating rate liability into fixed \\nrate liability. The Group due to its  AAA rated status commands one of the cheapest source of funding. Interest rate is fixed for the tenor of \\nthe Long term loans availed by the Group. Interest on Short term borrowings is subject to floating interest rate and are repriced regularly. The \\nsensitivity analysis detailed below have been determined based on the exposure to variable interest rates on the average outstanding amounts \\ndue to bankers over a year. The Group had issued floating interest rate Non-convertible debentures linked to 6 month T-Bill rate, to meet long \\nterm funding requirements.\\n   If the interest rates had been 1% higher / lower and all other variables held constant, the Group’s profit for the year ended 31st March, 2024 \\nwould have been decreased/increased by ` 14.25  Crores (Previous year ` 16.56 Crores).'),\n",

The Group manages the securities price risk through investments in debt funds and diversification by placing limits \\non individual and total investments.  Reports on Investment Portfolio are reviewed on regular basis and all approvals of investment decisions \\nare done in concurrence with the senior management.\\n   As at 31st March, 2024, the investments in debt mutual funds and bonds amounts to ` 3366.16 Crores (Previous year - ` 3071 Crores). A \\n1% point increase or decrease in the NAV with all other variables held constant would have lead to approximately an additional ` 34 Crores \\n(Previous year - ` 31 Crores) on either side in the statement of profit and loss.\\nii) Credit Risk\\n Is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Company. It arises from credit exposure to \\ncustomers, financial instruments viz., Investments in Equity Shares, Bonds, Debt Funds, Fixed Deposits others and Balances with Banks.\\n The Group’s marketing policies are well structured and all replacement sales are predominantly through dealers and the outstanding are secured by \\ndealer deposits.  As regards sales to O.E., and other institutional sales, the Group carries out periodic credit checks and also limits the exposure by \\nestablishing maximum payment period for customers and by offering prompt payment discounts.  The outstanding trade receivables due for a period \\nexceeding 180 days as at the year ended 31st March, 2024 is 0.02% (31st March, 2023 - 0.02%) of the total trade receivables.'),\n",
